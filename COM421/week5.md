# Topic 5 - Hash tables 

## What is a hash table?

A hash table allows us to look up values efficiently using non-numerical 
indices or keys.  For example, we might want to implement a dictionary in which the words are the keys and the descriptions, the values. Or we might want
to implement an address book in which the names arr the keys and the addresses,
the values. Another example would be a student records system in which the
student ID is the key and the full student record is the value.

We could implement this simply by creating objects containing the key and
the value, and then create an array containing many of these objects. However,
this is *inefficient*. To search for an item by key, we'd have to use a loop
(e.g. `while` or `for`) to search the array and compare the key of each item
with the key we're searching for. If there are say 10000 items in the array
this would be slow. We'd call this an *O(n)* operation, where *n* is the
index of the item we're searching for in the array - in other words, the
performance of the search depends on where the item is within the array.

We can do better than this, though, and implement this sort of look-up 
search at an efficiency close to *O(1)* (doesn't depend on the index or
the size of the array) using a *hash table*. A hash table is an efficient
data structure in which the keys (indices) are converted to a numerical
*hash code* using a mathematical function of some kind. This hash code is then 
used to look up the item in an underlying array. The hash code will be used as 
the array's index.


## An example

It's probably best to start with a very simple example.
A simple hash function might simply add the ASCII codes of the characters 
making up the key. We might use it in a dictionary program storing words
as the keys and their meanings as the values.

- e.g  for the key "cat" - summing the ASCII codes gives 99+97+116 = 312
-For the key "dog" - we get 100 + 111 + 103 = 314
- For the key "rat" - we get 114 + 97 + 116 = 327

The hash code returned from the hash function can then be used as the array
index to add the data to. So, we'd place the key/value pair "cat" and "Furry animal which goes meow" at index 312 in the underlying array. Similarly, we'd place the "dog" entry at index 314 and "rat" at index 327.


### Clashes

If, however, we try to add an entry containing the key "act" we have a problem.
The hash function for "act" would be 97+99+116 which equals 312. 312 has 
already been used for "cat". Thus we have a *clash*.
There are two common solutions to clashes, *separate chaining* and
*linear probing*.

### Separate chaining

With separate chaining, the underlying array is an array of "buckets". Each
item with a given hash code is placed into the bucket for that hash code, so
one bucket might have more than one item. In this example, "cat" and "act"
would be placed in the same bucket, as they have the same hash code. Each
bucket would contain a *list* (or array) of items.

This is shown ihe diagram below.

### Linear probing

Linear probing is an alternative approach. With linear probing, each array
index contains only *one* item, not a list. If there is a clash with hash codes,
the item is moved on to *the next available place in the array*. So, in the 
above example, both "cat" and "act" would have a hash code of 312. As "act"
is the second item to be added, it would be moved to the next available index
after 312, which is 313. This is shown in the diagram below. 

![Linear probing to resolve clashes](images/hash_probing.png)

The diagram also shows a second clash and how it's resolved with linear
probing. We try to add "sea". The hash code of "sea" is 313. However, *all
indices between 312 and 314 inclusive have been used up by this point*,
with "cat", "act" and "dog" respectively. So we have to move "sea" on
*two places* from its hash code, and add it to position 315 in the array.


Linear probing can lead to clusters if several keys have the same or similar hash code, which can be harder to search if we are looking up the entry using the key, because we have to move on several places along the array, which is 
inefficient in terms of time. However, separate chaining also has a time
efficiency issue, as we have to search through a list if there are clashes.
(Opinions differ on which is actually the most efficient)

### Better hash functions

The extremely simple hash function above, which simply adds the ASCII codes
of the characters making up the string, leads to a high probability of
clashes. So for this reason we must pick a hash function which ensures clashes 
have a low probability of occurring â€“ these typically perform a more complex operation on the characters of the key. 

When dealing with hash functions which produce a hash code for a string,
a typical approach is to multiply a numeric code for each character in turn by
a successive power of some factor **f** and sum the values together to arrive
at the final hash code. To minimise clashes this should be a fairly
large number; for example the Java language standard library uses 31.
So, the first character's ASCII code is multiplied
by **f^0** (1), the second character's code multiplied by **f^1**(f), the third
character's code is multiplied by **f^2**(f squared) and so on.

So the equation for this, where **f** is the chosen factor, **s** is the
string, and **n** is the length of the string, would be:
```
s[0]*f^0 + s[1]*f^1 + ... + s[n-1]*(f^(n-1))
```
This is easy to implement with a loop, as we can just loop from 0 up to the
length of the string and add all the values together to give the hash code.

(For what it's worth, the Java language does this in reverse, in other
words uses f^(n-1) for the first character and f^0 (i.e. 1) for the last,
but the same concept applies;
[Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)
)
 
Using this approach, while minimising clashes, will lead to large numbers
as hash codes. Even if we assume that only lower-case letters are valid
characters in the key (which means we can use the numbers 1-26 to represent
the letters rather than the full ASCII range), a small word like "cat", with a 
factor of 31, will give
(codes for 'c'=3; 'a'=1; 't'=20):
```
3*(31^0) + 1*(31^1) + 20*(31^2) = 3 + 31 + 19220 = 19254 
```
For longer words, the hash code is going to be an even bigger number.
This is clearly inefficient as, if we adopt the approach above without
taking any further steps, our underlying array is going to need 19254
spaces ('buckets' as they are called in hash table terminology) to even
be capable of storing a key like 'cat' !

So we then typically do a modulo operation. We decide how large our
underlying array is likely to be (which will depend on our 
particular use-case, but should be larger than the likely number of items in
the hash table) and take the modulo of that number. This will be a
trade-off: over-large arrays will waste memory, but over-small arrays will
lead to many clashes which means lookup will be slower as we will have to
search through longer lists (assuming separate chaining) at each position
or have to deal with more clusters (assuming linear probing). 
To minimise clashes, you should try and ensure your array is larger than
the likely number of entries in your hash table. (Opinions differ on exactly
how much larger, e.g. see [here](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/100074/determining-an-appropriate-number-of-buckets-for-a-hash-function) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/225621/how-many-hash-buckets), so it may be a case of experimentation to try and find a size which gives a tradeoff between memory efficiency and lookup time performance).

The chosen size should be prime (why this is, is explained below). So
imagine we had a likely maximum size of 100 entries, we could find a prime
number rather larger than 100, for instance 127. (For performance reasons
to do with the ability to do bit-shifting operations, powers of two minus one 
are often recommended, and 128 is a power of two). So in the above case, the 
array index (or bucket number) for 'cat' would be:
```
19254 % 127 = 77
```
so, 'cat' would be added to bucket 77 (where buckets are numbered from 0-126,
i.e. 127 buckets - the underlying array has a capacity of 127).

#### Why use a prime array size?

This is discussed [here](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/11029/why-is-it-best-to-use-a-prime-number-as-a-mod-in-a-hashing-function/64191#64191).
If our hash codes are truly random, there is no reason to use a prime bucket
size. However, in certain cases, we might want to store data which is 
numerically related in some way. For example, as discussed in the link above,
memory addresses are often multiples of 4, due to the way data is stored in
memory. So if we want to calculate a hash code for a variable based on its
memory address, all our hash codes will end up being multiples of 4. So using
a multiple of 4 for the array size (number of buckets) will be a poor choice
as clashes are very likely. All the buckets which are multiples of 4 will fill
up, while all the other buckets will remain empty.
This can be generalised: if the hash codes end
up being multiples of some number *n*, then choosing a hash code which is
also *n* or a multiple of *n* will end up with more clashes than expected
by chance. So a prime number,
(particularly a larger, 'obscure' prime number), where an enhanced likelihood 
of clashes will only occur if the hash codes are all multiples of that prime
number, should be chosen. Even if your hash codes will not be related in
any way, it's good practice to get into.

## Implementation details

Having looked at the basic workings of a hash table, how would we actually
implement it? A `Hashtable` class would have two key methods:

- `put(key, value)`, which adds a key/value pair to the hash table.
- `get(key)`, which looks up an item in the hash table using its
key. It should return the corresponding value.

We'll consider implementation using separate chaining, as it is the easiest
to implement of the two methods. We'll look at the `put()` operation first,
and then the `get()` operation.

`put()` is quite easy. (The first thing we have to do is convert the key to
a hash code using a hash function. We'd then need to add the key and value
to the appropriate 'bucket' in the array, using the hash code as its index.
Each 'bucket' holds a list (a linked list is generally recommended as it's
extensible), so you need to append the key and value to this listThe most efficient way of doing this in Python is with a tuple, so we'd create
a tuple containing the key and value, and add this tuple to the 
linked list). As an alternative to a linked list, you could use an extensible
array with a certain initial capacity, such as a Python `list`; searching would
be faster but there's the risk that a slow resize operation would have to
occur if the extensible array ran out of capacity.

**Question: why do you need to add the key and value to the list, and not
just the value?**

-`get()` is also fairly straightforward. (Again, we have to convert the key
to the hash code, find the 'bucket' with the index corresponding to the hash
code, and then search through the list within this bucket to find the entry
corresponding to the key).

### Advanced: Secondary hash function


To minimise clusters in linear probing, we can use a secondary hash function to calculate the displacement, and increase that number of places in the array in the case of a clash.

For example, if the secondary hash function gives 7 for "act", we'd place "act" at 312+7 = 319, rather than 313. This is shown on the diagram below:

![Secondary hash function](images/secondary_hash.png)

Secondary hash functions typically involve a modulo calculation for example:
```
secondaryHash = sumOfAsciiCodes % N
```
where N is some prime number (the reason for favouring prime numbers in hash
tables is discussed below). **The secondary hash function must be different
to the primary hash, in other words two keys with the same primary hash value
must have different secondary hash values. If they do not, the clustering 
problem will still occur.**
## Exercise 1 - Paper


1. Draw the 17-item hash table (array of 17 'buckets')
that results from using the hash function:

```
hashCode = (2i + 3) % 17
```
where `i` is the (numeric) key,
to hash the keys 36, 88, 54, 28, 49, 21, 63, 7, 19, 2, 11, 41 and 34, assuming 
collisions are handled by separate chaining. 

**Just calculate the hash code of each key using the equation above. This is
a simpler case than the example on the notes, which involved string rather
than numeric keys.**

		 							
2. Repeat question 1, but assume that collisions are handled by linear probing.

## Exercise 2 - Code

(*Question 1 is the most important question to finish, and ideally question
2; the later questions involving linear probing are more advanced
and designed for those of you coping well with the module so far*).

1. Implement a hash table using separate chaining. The keys should be strings
and the hash function should be simply the sum of the ASCII codes (this is a
poor hash function, as we have seen, but it's to keep things simple to begin
with). 

Use an underlying array with size 127 (i.e. 127 buckets), take the modulo 127 
of the hash code, and store the key and value as a tuple in the
corresponding list. Usse a simple Python list with an initial capacity of 5
(initialise it to 5 `None`s as we did last week) to store the values. 
A linked list is generally recommended, but again I'm trying to keep things
simple initially.

Implement `get()` and `put()` methods as described above.

Test the hash table by `put`ting a few keys and values into it and then
`get`ting them back. Try to choose at least two keys which will clash.

2. Enhance your hash table by using the "powers-of-31" approach (described
above) to calculate the hash code. You should still use modulo 127 to
calculate which bucket to place the value into.

3. Copy your answer to question 2 into a new Repl project, and change it
to use linear probing rather than separate chaining. Move forward one space
if there is a clash.

4. Enhance your linear probing-based hash table to use a secondary hash
function to calculate how many spaces to move on when searching for a free
space. It should be:
```
secondaryHash = hashCode % 17 
```
where `hashCode` is the primary hash, i.e. the hash code calculated from
the "powers-of-31" approach above.
