<h1>Topic 18: Promises</h1>
</div>
<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> This is an advanced topic which is aimed at
those of you finding the unit, and programming in general, relatively
straightforward. 
You should only attempt this if you are <strong>confident</strong>
programming functions, callbacks, and passing arguments to functions, and 
have completed <strong>all</strong>
previous exercises from the majority of previous topics (Topics 1-5, 6-8 and 11-12) and are confident with your answers.If you are struggling with the unit you will struggle immensely with this topic, so 
it is recommended that you catch up with
previous topics first. You can then return to this topic later, when you
are thoroughly confident with previous topics and working
with functions and callbacks.</p>
<h2>Using Promises</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
A promise is an object which "promises" to do a particular (typically)
asynchronous, background task which will complete at some point in the future. 
An AJAX request is a typical example; promises are used extensively in 
AJAX development. 
One of two functions are called depending on whether it fulfilled that
"promise":
    <ul>
    <li>a "resolve" function if it did fulfil the promise;</li>
    <li>and a "reject" function if it didn't.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
Promises allow you to write code with intuitive, clean syntax in
this form:
<pre>promise.then(resolveFunction).catch(rejectFunction);</pre>
where "promise" is the promise object.
What this code means is: 
<pre>Perform the task associated with a promise, <em>then</em> run a  function (resolveFunction in this example) which runs if the promise is fulfilled, 
and <em>catch</em> any  error conditions with an error handling function 
(rejectFunction in this example).</pre>
Hopefully you can see that this code is cleaner than the typical callback-based
AJAX code. In general, <strong>Promises allow us to write code for asynchronous 
processes (i.e. callback based processes, where a function runs at some 
future point) in a cleaner and more sequential way.</strong> This is because
the "resolve" function <em>will only run once the asynchronous
task (e.g. AJAX call) has completed</em>.
</p>
<p>
Promises produce cleaner code;
however, learning how to write a promise in the first place is 
conceptually harder than the "classic" approach to asynchronous tasks 
such as AJAX. 
However, <strong>using</strong> pre-written Promises is easy, so once you've
written your promise, coding does become easier!</p>

<h3>How to implement a promise</h3>
<p>
A promise has an associated <em>task</em>, which is a background
task which may either succeed (fulfilling the promise) or fail
(rejecting the promise). This task is implemented as 
a <em>function</em> which 
<em>must be passed into the Promise constructor as a 
parameter</em>. This task function <em>must</em> take two parameters, each of
which is themselves a callback function, and each of which was described
above:
    <ul>
    <li>the <em>resolve</em> function (called if the promise is fulfilled)</li>
    <li>the <em>reject</em> function (called if the promise cannot be fulfilled)</li>
    </ul>
Each of these is specified by the code calling the promise; the
argument to <em>then()</em> ends up as the <em>resolve</em> function
and the argument to <em>catch()</em> ends up as the <em>reject</em>
function.
</p>
<p>
The task function must then call these two functions as appropriate,
i.e. if the task succeeds, it must call the <em>resolve</em> function
and if it fails, it must call the <em>reject</em> function.
</p>

<h3>Simple example</h3>
<p>We are going to start by writing some promises to perform simple
mathematical operations, and then move onto a more "real world" example
in the form of a promise-based AJAX call.</p>

<h4>Division promise</h4>

<p>Here is an example of a promise to perform a division of two numbers.
The promise is fulfilled with the result of the division, or rejects if the
denominator is zero (remember that division by zero is not allowed).
You can write this on Neptune as node.js code, or in the browser.</p>
<pre>
function divide(a,b) {
    return new Promise ( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {
        if(b == 0) {
            reject("Cannot divide by zero!");
        } else {
            resolve(a/b);
        }
    });
}
</pre>
Note what we are doing here is writing a function called <em>divide()</em>
which divides two numbers and returns a Promise to do the division.
Note how the Promise constructor 
takes, as an argument, a task function which attempts to
carry out the promise. This task function gets passed two parameters, a 
resolve function and a reject function, as we saw above. The task function then tests
if the denominator (b)is zero, and if it is, the promise is rejected with
a message "Cannot divide by zero!". Otherwise, the promise is fulfilled and
the resolve function is called, with the result of the division.
</p>
<p>Calling the promise</p>
<p>To call the promise, we call the function which returns the promise
and chain it with a <em>then()</em> call. <em>then()</em> takes a 
function as an argument; this function will run as soon as the promise is
fulfilled. This function corresponds to the <em>resolve</em> parameter to
the Promise constructor. So whatever is passed to <em>then()</em> will
become the <em>resolve</em> parameter of the Promise.
<pre>divide(18, 2).then( result =&gt; { console.log(result); } );</pre>
</p>
<h4>Handling promise rejections</h4>
<p>To handle a promise rejection (e.g. division by zero in the example
above), we chain a <em>catch()</em> to our promise call, e.g:
<pre>divide(18, 0).then( result =&gt; { console.log(result); } ).<em>catch(err =&gt; { console.log(err); } );</em></pre>
Note how <em>catch()</em> also takes a function as an argument; this function
corresponds to the <em>reject</em> parameter of the Promise constructor. So
whatever is passed to <em>catch()</em> will become the <em>reject</em>
parameter of the promise.</p>

<h3>Chaining promises</h3>
<p>Promises are frequently <em>chained</em> together. We perform one operation
which returns a promise, and then if the promise fulfils, we can call
another function, using this form of code:
<pre>function1.then(function2).then(function3).catch(e =&gt; {
    console.log(`Error: ${e}`);
}););</pre>
</p>
<p>What's this doing? We're calling function 1, which returns a promise.
If the promise fulfils, then we call function2, which also returns a
promise. If <em>that</em> promise fulfils, we call function 3. But if
<em>any</em> of the promises reject, then the <em>catch</em> function will
run and report the error associated with the rejection.</p>
<p>A key, important point about promise chaining is that <em>the value
associated with a promise is passed as an argument to the resolve
function</em>. For example
<pre>
function divide(a,b) {
    return new Promise ( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {
        if(b == 0) {
            reject("Cannot divide by zero!");
        } else {
            resolve(a/b);
        }
    });
}

function squareroot(n) {
    return new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {
        if(n &lt; 0) {
            reject("Cannot square-root a negative number!");
        } else {
            resolve(Math.sqrt(n));
        }
    });
}

function countTo(n) {
    return new Promise( (resolve, reject) =&gt; {
        if(n &lt;= 0) {
            reject("Cannot count to a number less than 1!");
        } else {
            for(let i=1; i&lt;=n; i++) {
                console.log(i);
            }
        }
    });
</pre>
We can chain these as follows:
<pre>divide(100,4).then(squareroot).then(countTo).catch(e =&gt; {
    console.log(e);
});</pre>
What happens here, exactly?
    <ul>
    <li>We divide 100 by 4. The <em>divide()</em> function returns a 
    promise, which will be fulfilled with a/b if the denominator is not zero,
    and with reject with a "Cannot divide by zero!" message if it is.
    </li>
    <li>This promise is returned by <em>divide()</em>. If the promise
    succeeds, we run the argument to its <em>then()</em>, which is its
    resolve function; here, this will be the <em>squareroot()</em> 
    function.</li>
    <li>The <em>squareroot()</em> then itself returns a promise, with a
    resolve function which receives the square root of the number.
    This promise will reject if the number is negative (as we cannot 
    square root negative numbers... unless we are dealing with imaginary 
    numbers, which is well out of scope for this subject!)</li>
    <li><em>This</em> promise then takes <em>countTo</em> as its argument
    to <em>then()</em>, which means that <em>countTo()</em> will be called
    if the <em>squareroot</em> promise succeeds.</li> 
    </ul>

    
<h3>AJAX</h3>
<p>Here is a further, more complex example of using promises. In this example
we develop a Promise to perform an AJAX request. If the AJAX request
succeeds (i.e. it returns an HTTP code not in the 400-599 range) we
call our resolve function and pass it the response text returned from the
server. If on the other hand, the HTTP code returned is in the 400-599 (error)
range, we reject the promise with the error code.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of such a Promise associated with an AJAX request.
<pre>
function ajaxPromise(url) {
    return new Promise(
            (resolve,reject)=&gt; // this is the task function
            { 
                var xhr2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
                xhr2.open('GET', url);
                xhr2.addEventListener("load", (e)=&gt; 
                {              
                    if(e.target.status&gt;=400 &amp;&amp; e.target.status&lt;=599)
                    {
                        // pass the HTTP code to the reject function
                        reject(e.target.status);  
                    } 
                    else 
                    {
                        // pass the response text to resolve function
                        resolve(e.target.responseText);
                    }
                } );
                xhr2.send();
            }
        );
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
To use our promise-based AJAX request:
<pre>
ajaxPromise('/artist/Oasis').then(ajaxSuccess).catch(handleError);
</pre>
where <em>ajaxSuccess</em> is a function which processes a successful
AJAX request and <em>handleError()</em> is a function which processes
error conditions.
The arguments to the resolve and reject functions would then be passed to
<em>ajaxSuccess()</em> and <em>handleError()</em>, respectively:
<pre>
function ajaxSuccess(responseText) 
{
    var data = JSON.parse(responseText);
    // do something with the data..
}

function handleError(error) 
{
    alert('Error: ' + error);
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>We could also use promise chains in AJAX. For example if the AJAX
promise is fulfilled, we could then perform another promise to parse the JSON
returned.
<pre>ajaxPromise('/artist/Oasis').then(parseJson).then(showJsonResults).catch(handleError)
</pre>
How might this work? The idea is that <em>parseJson()</em> itself returns
a further promise. It might look like this:
<pre>
function parseJson(responseText) 
{
    return new Promise ( (resolve,reject) =&gt;
        {
            var parsedData = JSON.parse(responseText);
            if(parsedData.length==0) {
                reject("No matching results!");
            } else {
                resolve(parsedData);
            }
        }
    );
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<em>showJsonResults()</em> would then receive the <em>parsedData</em> in
the above example, because <em>showJsonResults</em> is the resolve function
passed to the <em>then()</em> of the promise returned by <em>parseJson()</em>.
As <em>parsedData()</em> is the result of <em>JSON.parse()</em>, it 
will be (typically) an array of objects so it can be processed in the usual
way:
<pre>
function showJsonResults(data)
{
    var html = "";
    data.forEach ( flight=&gt;  
    
        {
            html = html + `Depart ${flight.depart} Arrive ${flight.arrive} &lt;br /&gt;`;
        });
        
    document.getElementById("results").innerHTML = html; 
}    
</pre>
</p>
<h4>Passing functions which do NOT return promises to then()</h4>
<p>However, we can make it even simpler. We can rewrite our
<em>parseJson()</em> in this way and the promise chaining will still take
place:
<pre>function parseJson(responseText) 
{
    return JSON.parse(responseText);
}</pre>
Why will this work, when <em>parseJson()</em> doesn't return a Promise?
The reason is that <em>if a function which does <strong>NOT</strong>
return a Promise</em> is passed to <em>then()</em>, 
a <em>new Promise object</em> will automatically be 
created, wrapping the data returned by the function.</p>
<p>A reminder of the chain:
<pre>ajaxPromise('webservice.php').then(parseJson).then(showJsonResults)</pre>
The first <em>then</em> returns a Promise to run <em>parseJson()</em>.
If <em>parseJson()</em> runs successfully (it always will here), then a
promise will be created, it will call 
<em>showJsonResults()</em> as its resolve function and 
the return value of parseJson() will be passed as an argument to
showJsonResults().</p>
<p>As a result of this, we can completely remove our parseJson() function
altogether  and simply pass <em>JSON.parse</em> in as the argument to the
first <em>then()</em>:
<pre>ajaxPromise('webservice.php').then(JSON.parse).then(showJsonResults)</pre>
Why? JSON.parse() returns the parsed JSON, and a promise will be created
automatically (as before), wrapping the parsed JSON, which will be
fulfilled with 
the argument to the next <em>then()</em>, namely <em>showJsonResults()</em>.
Consequently, showJsonResults() will receive the return value of 
JSON.parse().</p>
<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
<p>Make a copy of your AJAX search script from Topic 6 
(the basic version, <strong>not the version using DOM</strong>) and change it 
so that the AJAX is performed using promises.</p>
<h2>New style AJAX requests: the fetch API</h2>
<p>Above we saw how to do AJAX requests using promises. However, 
standards-compliant browsers (such as Firefox and Chrome) now have a 
<em>built in</em> API - the fetch API- which uses promises. You can use the
fetch API without having to write an AJAX promise yourself. Here is a simple
example:
<pre>fetch('http://www.free-map.org.uk').then(response =&gt; response.text()).then(console.log);</pre>
</pre>
<em>fetch()</em> returns a promise to return the response from the
given URL. The resolve function of this promise takes, as a parameter,
a <em>response object</em>. This is <em>not</em> the same as a traditional
XMLHttpRequest, but does have a couple of interesting methods:
    <ul>
    <li><em>text()</em>, which returns a Promise which passes the response
    text to its resolve function. <strong>This is being used here. The
    response text will be passed to its resolve function, which here is simply
    console.log(), so the response will be displayed on the console.</strong> 
    <li><em>json()</em>, which returns a Promise which passes parsed JSON to
    its resolve function. </li>
    </ul>
So to use fetch() with a function which looks through JSON results, we could
do:
<pre>fetch('https://example.com/api/artist/Oasis').then(response =&gt; response.text()).then(showJsonResults);

function showJsonResults(text)
{
    var data = JSON.parse(text);    
    var html = "";
    data.forEach ( flight=&gt;  
    
        {
            html = html + `Depart ${flight.depart} Arrive ${flight.arrive} &lt;br /&gt;`;
        });
        
    document.getElementById("results").innerHTML = html; 
}</pre>
</p>
<p>We can make this easier though with the <em>response.json()</em> promise,
which promises to parse the JSON returned and resolves with the parsed JSON,
e.g:
<pre>fetch('https://example.com/api/artist/Oasis').then(response =&gt; response.json()).then(showJsonResults);

function showJsonResults(data)
{
    var html = "";
    data.forEach ( flight=&gt;  
    
        {
            html = html + `Depart ${flight.depart} Arrive ${flight.arrive} &lt;br /&gt;`;
        });
        
    document.getElementById("results").innerHTML = html; 
}</pre>

<h3>Using the fetch API with POST, PUT and DELETE</h3>
<p>One advantage of the <em>fetch</em> API is that you can easily send not only GET and POST
requests but also PUT and DELETE. Here are some examples of each method:</p>
<h4>POST</h4>
<pre>var flight = { depart: '0900', arrive: '1200', price: 100.0, flightnumber: 'SA101', destination: 'Rome' };
fetch('/flight/create', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(flight),  
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }).then(...);
</pre>
This will send a POST request to the route <em>/flight/create</em>. Note how we send the POST data here.
Rather than sending post fields via a FormData object as described in <a href='DOM.html'>Topic 7</a>, 
we populate the <em>body</em> of the HTTP request with
JSON representing the flight. Note also how we have to set the <em>Content-Type</em> header appropriately.</p>
<p>We can read the JSON back using Slim in a similar way to regular POST fields. The <em>getParsedBody()</em> method:
<pre>$req-&gt;getParsedBody();</pre>
will return an associative array containing the parsed JSON.</p>
<h4>DELETE</h4>
<p>DELETE requests are easy:
<pre>fetch('/flight/9818', { method: 'DELETE'}).then(...);</pre>
</p>
<h4>PUT</h4>
<p>PUT follows a similar pattern to POST. JSON is sent to the server within the
body of the request. On the server side (Slim), the PUT data is read in the same way as PUT data sent over 
cURL (see <a href='wad5.html'>topic 5</a>):
<pre>var flight = { depart: '0930', arrive: '1230'};
fetch('/flight/9819', { method: 'PUT', body: JSON.stringify(flight),  
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }).then(...);
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
<p>Make a further copy of your AJAX exercise (Topic 6) and change it to use
the fetch API. Again, it should be the basic version,
<strong>not the version using DOM</strong></p>
<h3>fetch API from Node</h3>
<p>You can use a third-party implementation of the <em>fetch</em> API
to perform cURL-like requests from a Node app. Install <em>node-fetch</em>:
<pre>sudo npm install -g node-fetch</pre>
You can then write code such as:
<pre>const fetch = require('node-fetch');
fetch('http://www.free-map.org.uk').then(response =&gt; response.text()).then(console.log);</pre>
</p>
<h2>async/await</h2>
<p>ECMAScript 8 (aka ECMAScript 2017) introduces <em>async/await</em>.
This allows you to write promise-based,
asynchronous code in a sequential manner. Here is how we would rewrite our
own custom Promise-based AJAX code (i.e. not using the <em>fetch</em> API)
using async/await:
<pre>
<em>async</em> function ajaxrequest() 
{
    var a = document.getElementById("origin").value;
    var b = document.getElementById("destination").value;
    var url = `/artist/Oasis`;
    var responseText = <em>await</em> ajaxPromise(url);
    var data = JSON.parse(responseText);
    showJsonResults(data);
}
</pre>
Note how we're doing a whole AJAX / JSON parsing procedure using sequential
code, even though AJAX is an asynchronous process. The key things are:
    <ul>
    <li>The function <em>ajaxrequest()</em> is declared as <em>async</em>, 
    which makes it a special kind of function (an <em>AsyncFunction</em>)
    allowing us to do async/await;</li>
    <li><em>ajaxPromise()</em> (which if you remember returns a Promise to do an
    AJAX call) is preceded by <em>await</em>. What <em>await()</em> does is
    suspend execution of the rest of the <em>async</em> function until the
    Promise concerned has been fulfilled. 
    The argument to the resolve function of
    the Promise is then <em>returned</em> from the <em>await</em> call.
    </li>
    <li>Note that the Promise has no specified resolve function as there is
    no <em>then()</em> here. What is happening is that when the Promise has
    been fulfilled, rather than calling a particular resolve function, it 
    returns back to the <em>async</em> function and hands the argument to
    the resolve function back so that it becomes the return value of the <em>await</em>.</li>
    </ul>
Note also that <em>await</em> will only work with a Promise. It's
<em>awaiting the successful resolution of that Promise</em>. Trying to use
<em>await</em> without a Promise will not work!</li>
</p>
<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write another version of your HT-Tracks AJAX front end to use async/await.
Use your own custom Promise-based AJAX system, not <em>fetch()</em>.</li>
<li>Change the code to use async/await with <em>fetch()</em>. I haven't shown 
you how to do this explicitly, but you should be able to figure it out!</li>
</ul>
