<h1>Topic 12: Further Web Mapping</h1>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Today we will look at some additional web mapping topics, specifically: 
    <ul>
    <li>Geolocation API</li>
    <li>Displaying markers from a web service</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>The Geolocation API</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Geolocation API allows you to obtain the current location of the
device running the browser from within JavaScript. Even on desktop browsers
this will give a result if you are using a wireless network, but its real
use is in the mobile web development world. A mobile browser can talk to the
GPS chip of the phone and obtain the phone's current location on the earth.
Alternatively, if the GPS chip is not available, a rough estimate can be
obtained from cell towers or wireless networks.</p>
<h4>Using the Geolocation API</h4>
<p>It is fairly straightforward to use the Geolocation API. Here is an 
example (<strong>please note - all examples in this topic will show the JavaScript only, not the HTML</strong>):
<pre>


function init()
{
    if(navigator.geolocation)
    {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition (

            gpspos=&gt; {
                console.log(`Lat ${gpspos.coords.latitude} Lon ${gpspos.coords.longitude}`); // show on the console
            },

            err=&gt; {
                alert(`An error occurred: ${err.code}`);
            }

        );
    }
    else
    {
        alert("Sorry, geolocation not supported in this browser");
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>How is this working?
    <ul>
    <li>When the page first loads, the <em>init()</em> function runs. This
    tests whether geolocation is possible in our browser by checking for the
    existence of the <em>navigator.geolocation</em> variable. If it doesn't
    exist, we display an error. If it <em>does</em> exist, we tell the
    geolocation object to obtain the current position with 
    <em>getCurrentPosition()</em>. This takes two arguments, both functions:
        <ul>
        <li>The first argument (an arrow function here)
        is the function that will run as soon as we get a 
        location back from the GPS chip (or wireless network, etc)</li>
        <li>The second (here, another arrow function) will run if there
        was an error obtaining the location.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Note the <em>asynchronous</em> approach here, just like AJAX. It might
    take time to obtain a position, so we set up a <em>callback</em>
    function to run once we have obtained the position, and continue
    processing in the meantime. So any statements below the 
    <em>getCurrentPosition()</em> might run before 
    the callback <em>processPosition()</em> starts running.
    </li>
    <li>Considering each of these two functions in turn, let's look at
    <em>processPosition()</em> first. This is automatically supplied with
    one parameter, <em>gpspos</em>, which is an object 
    representing the position returned from the GPS device or other location provider. This object has a property <em>coords</em> representing the
    coordinates, and <em>coords</em> itself has two properties,
    <em>latitude</em> and <em>longitude</em>.
    Therefore, we can obtain the latitude and
    longitude with <em>gpspos.coords.latitude</em> and 
    <em>gpspos.coords.longitude</em>. So what this example is doing is
    displaying the coordinates in the console (you can view the console
    via More Tools-Developer Tools in Chrome or Web Developer-Web Console
    in Firefox).</li>
    <li>Moving onto <em>handleError()</em> which is the function which
    is run if there is any sort of error in obtaining the position: again, 
    this is automatically supplied with one parameter, <em>err</em>,
    an object representing the exact error which occurred. The most meaningful
    property of <em>err</em> is a numerical code, <em>err.code</em>, which
    is what we are displaying here. There are several codes
    (ref <a href='http://www.diveintohtml5.info/geolocation.html'>Dive into 
    HTML5</a>, Mark Pilgrim):
        <ul>
        <li>1 means that the user denied the browser access to the device's
        location. For security reasons, a user has to agree to the browser
        accessing the device's GPS chip, and if they deny that access, the
        error function will run with a code of 1.</li>
        <li>2 means that the location could not be obtained, e.g the
        GPS satellites or wireless networks are unavailable;</li>
        <li>3 means a timeout, i.e. the GPS satellites or network are 
        available but it has taken too long to contact them.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Watching the position</h3>
<p>The above code will simply obtain the current position and stop. In a
typical mobile GPS application, however, the user will want to be informed
of their location on a regular basis. To do this we use 
<em>watchPosition()</em> in place of <em>getCurrentPosition()</em>. Here is
an example:
<pre>

function init()
{
    if(navigator.geolocation)
    {
        navigator.geolocation.watchPosition (

            gpspos=&gt; {
                console.log(`Lat ${gpspos.coords.latitude} Lon ${gpspos.coords.longitude}`); // show on the console
            },

            err=&gt; {
                alert(`An error occurred: ${err.code}`);
            },

            {enableHighAccuracy:true, maximumAge: 5000 }

        );
    }
    else
    {
        alert("Sorry, geolocation not supported in this browser");
    }
}

</pre>
</p>
<p>Note that the code is almost the same as the first example, except:
    <ul>
    <li>We use <em>watchPosition()</em> rather than 
    <em>getCurrentPosition()</em>. The result will be that the GPS chip 
    (or other location provider) will communicate the current location back
    to the process position arrow 
    function every time the location changes, rather 
    than just the once.</li>
    <li>Note also the additional options passed as a third parameter to
    <em>watchPosition()</em>. On many mobile devices, if we want to use the
    GPS chip (rather than cell towers, wireless networks, etc) we have
    to set the <em>enableHighAccuracy</em> option to <em>true</em>. Also
    if we want to force the GPS to return a reading every so-many seconds,
    we have to specify a value for the <em>maximumAge</em> option, in 
    milliseconds. So the above example will refresh at least every 5 
    seconds.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>IMPORTANT - Geolocation API now needs HTTPS server</h3>
<p>For security reasons (the risk of your location being intercepted by
packet-sniffers) the Geolocation API now (recently at the
time of writing) requires the use of an HTTPS server (a web server with
encrypted communication), on both Chrome and Firefox. 
Luckily Edward2 has HTTPS, so the examples will work as expected.</p>
<p>See <a href='https://letsencrypt.org'>Let's Encrypt</a> for information on
setting up an HTTPS server.</p>
<h3>Exercise 1 - Geolocation</h3>
<p><strong>This is a key exercise; if you have completed Topic 11 Exercise 1
and Topic 11 Exercise 2 questions 1-2, you should attempt it before you
finish previous work.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try out the first geolocation example above, to show that it works
(it should work, using the university's wifi network).</li>
<li>Use the Geolocation API to obtain your current position, and
display a Leaflet map at zoom 14 centred on that position. How you should
approach this is as follows: 
    <ul>
    <li>Add the Leaflet setup code to your init() function for the
    basic geolocation example above.
     Set the map's location initially
     to an arbitrary location e.g. latitude 51, longitude -1. 
    </li>
    <li>In your geolocation success callback,
    adjust the map to the new position received. </li>
    </ul>
You might notice, through reading the Leaflet API, that there is a shortcut
way of doing this.... but for practise, use the above method!
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Displaying markers from a web service</h2>
<p>A common use of web mapping is to show data from a web service on a 
map. For example, we might want to show the location of restaurants in a 
particular city on a web map. This is quite easy - you simply need to make an
AJAX request to a web service, parse the JSON (or XML) returned and create
markers using the data. The following exercise will allow you to explore
this.</p>
<h3>Exercise 2 - Connecting to a web service and displaying markers</h3>
<p>In the <em>dftitutorials</em> database on edward2 is a table called
<em>artists</em> which gives the latitude and longitude of the home towns
of selected artists (Oasis, Madonna, The Beatles, David Bowie, Prince,
Michael Jackson, Woop, Ed Sheeran).
There is also a web service at 
<em>https://edward2.solent.ac.uk/wad/artists.php</em>
which takes an artist as a query string parameter called <em>artist</em>
and returns JSON describing the home town of that artist and
the latitude and longitude of that home town.</p>
<p>Modify your HT-Tracks AJAX page (Session 6) so that as well as a 
"Search" button, there is a "Where is this artist from?" button. This should 
connect to a <em>new JavaScript function</em>
which sends an AJAX request to this web 
service. Also modify your <em>init()</em> function from your AJAX exercise so
that it initialises a Leaflet map. You'll need to declare the Leaflet map
globally so that it can be accessed from multiple functions:
<pre>var map; // make the 'map' variable global

function init() {
    map = L.map("map1"); // Initialise the map in init()
    // ... etc ...
}</pre>
</p>
<p>In the AJAX callback, parse the JSON returned so that a 
marker is shown on the map for that artist, and the map is centred at 
the artist's hometown. When the marker is clicked,
the name of the home town of the artist should be shown in a popup.</p>
<p>If no query string parameters are passed to the web service, the home 
towns of <em>all</em> the artists are shown. Add a new button to the
HT-Tracks AJAX page labelled "Show Home Towns Of All Artists".
By making an AJAX request to the web service, it should show the location of
the home towns of <em>all</em> the artists on the map, 
along with a popup giving information about the artist and their home town.</p>
