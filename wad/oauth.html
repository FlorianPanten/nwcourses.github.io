<h1>The Wednesday Web Session 2</h1>
<h1>Introduction to OAuth</h1>
</div>



<h2>A question of trust</h2>

<p>Imagine a situation in which operations of a web service which change the database
(such as leaving a review for HT-Tracks, or booking an item of accommodation for 
PlacesToStay) required the user to login. Now imagine that client websites, such as
your fan site or VisitHampshire, wanted to allow <em>their</em> users to perform
these operations. How could it be done?
    <ul>
    <li>The client websites could have their own special login, such as
    <em>visithampshire</em>. All changes made through the client website are
    done under that login. This would mean, however, that it would be impossible
    to determine which user did what.</li>
    <li>The user could provide their web service login credentials to the
    <em>client</em> site, and these could be sent over the web (e.g. cURL request)
    to the web service. If HTTPS is used, this would be reasonably secure,
    <em>but</em> the client site developer is asking the users to <em>trust</em> them
    with their web service login credentials. 
    <strong>This is not a good idea.</strong> In a world seemingly full of
    cyber-criminals and ethically-questionable people 
    quite willing to exploit your personal data for their own gain or for the gain of shady third-parties, 
    you want to minimise the number of parties you share your credentials with.
    In the assignment scenario, for example, VisitHampshire might not have such strong
    security as PlacesToStay and thus the credentials may be stolen. Or the client website
    may misuse the user's credentials.</li>
    </ul>
Consequently, <strong>another approach to cross-site authentication is needed</strong> and this
is where OAuth comes in. OAuth allows
client sites to authenticate with services via <em>tokens</em>. With OAuth,
we have a <em>provider</em> which provides an OAuth service (this would
be the web service) and a <em>consumer</em> which uses the service
(the web service client). The user logs in on the <em>provider</em>
site and then receives an <em>access token</em> to access any web service URLs
(API endpoints) which need authorisation. The current version of the OAuth standard is
<strong>OAuth 2</strong>, which allows a number of different <em>grant types</em>
(mechanisms for granting access to a consumer to act on behalf of a user).
We will consider the <em>authorisation code</em> grant type, as it more secure than some of the
other options (e.g plain username/password)</p>
<h2>General requirements for developing an OAuth2 client</strong>
<h3>Client needs to register with the server</h3>
<p><strong>Firstly the client site (consumer) needs to identify
itself to the service (provider).</strong> This is done as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>Each consumer (client, e.g. the fan site or VisitHampshire) 
    <em>registers</em> with  the provider (web service). The web service gives the consumer a 
    unique key and secret, both unique codes which can be used to identify the 
    consumer to the provider. The secret is required for security and must, as the name
    suggests, be kept secret. For example if we are developing a PHP application, the
    secret could be placed in an include file which would not be included in the 
    application's Git repository.</li>
    
    <li>When registering, the consumer typically needs to be logged in to the
    provider's site (so that the provider knows who they are, and appropriate action can be
    taken against malicious clients) and a <em>callback</em> - a 
    page on the consumer site which the user will be redirected to once they
    have logged in on the provider site.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>User authentication with OAuth2</h3>
<p>
Here is a description of the entire OAuth2 authentication process which takes place
when the user interacts with a client (consumer) site.
    <ol>
    <li>User clicks an "authenticate" link on the consumer.</li>
    <li>Request containing the client key and secret sent to the OAuth
    provider - specifically a URL designated as the <strong>authorize</strong> endpoint.</li>
    <li>OAuth provider checks key and secret, and if valid, asks the user to 
    <strong>grant permission to the consumer to carry out operations on their
    behalf</strong>. In other words, the user is <strong>explicitly stating that they
    trust the consumer to perform operations on the provider</strong>.
    If the user grants permission, the provider sends back an
    <em>authorisation code</em>. This is a temporary code used during the
    authorisation process only. The provider redirects the user to the
    registered <em>callback URL</em> on the consumer site.</li>
    <li>Back on the consumer side, if an authorisation code has been received, the consumer
    then sends another request to the <strong>access_token</strong> endpoint to obtain an access 
    token from the authorisation code. Unlike the authorisation code, the access token is long-lived
    and can be used to perform operations on behalf of the user.</li>
    <li>The user can then perform an operation which requires an access token, such as leave
    a review or book a hotel. The access token is sent within the HTTP header of the
    request as a 
    <em>bearer token</em> under the Authorization header, e.g:
    <pre>Authorization: Bearer 0dc176676acfb98987edcb787....</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Access tokens remain active until they time out or the user <em>revokes</em> them.
    Typically, a user can log onto the provider's site and view all their
    active tokens. Each token can then be revoked by the user. Until a token
    is revoked, that token will remain active: an approach taken by some
    developers (e.g 
    <a href='http://hdyc.neis-one.org'>OSM How Did You Contribute?</a>), is
    to store the user's access token as a cookie so that they don't get a
    new token each time they use a consumer; instead they are automatically
    authenticated using the access token stored in the cookie.
    An OAuth provider might also wish to provide an API call to
    revoke a token.</li>    
    </ol>

<h2>Very useful resource for more details</h2>
<p>Aaron Parecki has written an in-depth introduction to OAuth2: this can be found
<a href='https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified'>here</a></p>.
<h2>Implementation details</h2>
<p>PHP has an official OAuth extension which makes it relatively easy to develop
OAuth clients and servers, but unfortunately this only supports OAuth1, not OAuth2.
(OpenStreetMap still uses OAuth1, so if you need to write a consumer to OSM, you'll have to
develop an OAuth1 client). However, luckily a third party library exists for developing an OAuth2 client, namely
the PHP League's <em>oauth-client</em>. This can be obtained 
<a href='https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client'>here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Writing an OAuth client (consumer)</h3>
<p>The logic of an OAuth2 client is set out below. We are assuming here that a 
single page, <em>index.php</em>, both sends the original authorisation request 
<em>and</em> acts as the registered callback.
<img src="../images/oauth2_logic.png" alt="OAuth2 client logic"/>
</p>
<p>
Our script starts by checking whether an authorisation code was passed in via GET. If it was,
we've redirected from the /authorize endpoint on the provider. If it wasn't, we're starting from
the beginning and so need to request an authorisation code:
<pre>
&lt;?php
// Load our Composer-installed dependencies
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'; 

// Create an object representing the provider.
// Note how we have to provide our client ID and secret, and also
// the /authorize and /access_token endpoints.
// We also supply the redirect URL in case we didn't specify it when we
// registered our app.

$provider = new \League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\GenericProvider([
    'clientId' => 'YOUR CLIENT ID',
    'clientSecret' => 'YOUR CLIENT SECRET',
    'redirectUri' => 'YOUR CLIENT REDIRECT URL',
    'urlAuthorize' => '/authorize ENDPOINT ON PROVIDER',
    'scope' => 'all',
    'urlAccessToken' => '/access_token ENDPOINT ON PROVIDER',
    'urlResourceOwnerDetails' => 'BASE URL OF PROVIDER API'
]);

session_start();

// If an authorisation code was NOT supplied as a query string..
if(!isset($_GET["code"])) {

    // Get the full URL for the /authorize endpoint
    $authUrl = $provider->getAuthorizationUrl();
    
    // Get the state (see below)
    $_SESSION['state'] = $provider->getState();
    
    // Redirect to our /authorize endpoint
    header("Location: $authUrl");
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>Most of this has been explained in the code comments. The only aspect which has not
is the <em>state</em>. Note that when we begin, we store the provider object's state
in a session variable. This is a random string which we store in a session variable
and check later, when we get the 
code back from the provider; we check that the provider sends back the same state we
started with. This guards against interception attacks during the authorisation
process.</p>

<p>Next, we write the code to handle the authorisation code having been returned from the
provider:
<pre>
// Check that the state sent back from the server is the same as the original (see above)
elseif(empty($_GET['state']) || (isset($_SESSION['state']) && $_GET['state']!=$_SESSION['state'])) {
    unset($_SESSION['state']);
    echo "Possible security violation detected - quitting";
} else {
    if(!isset($_SESSION["accessToken"])) {
        echo "No saved access token, getting one &lt;br /&gt;";
        $accessToken = $provider->getAccessToken('authorization_code',
            ["code"=>$_GET["code"]]);
        $_SESSION["accessToken"] = $accessToken;
    } else {
        echo "We already have an access token, using that";
        $accessToken = $_SESSION["accessToken"];
    }
    echo "Has access token expired? ".($accessToken->hasExpired() ? 'yes': 'no')."&lt;br /&gt;";
    ....
</pre>
Hopefully this code should be clear. We first check the state (see above) and then 
see if we have an <em>access</em> token stored in a session variable already. If we have,
we can use it. If we haven't, we need to exchange the authorisation code for an access token
by calling the access token endpoint of the provider. This code example also displays whether
the access token has expired or not. If it has expired, it will no longer be possible to use
it to call our provider API.</p>
<p>Next, now that we have an access token, we can use it to make an API call.
This is making an imaginary call to a <em>photo/upload</em> route in the provider's
web service API:
<pre>
    // Form an object representing the HTTP request
    $request = $provider->getAuthenticatedRequest(
        'POST',
        'http://localhost/oauth/oauth_server/api/photo/upload',
        $accessToken
    );
    echo "&lt;h2&gt;Making a request to the Open Panos API&lt;/h2&gt;";

        
    // GuzzleHttp is an object-oriented PHP HTTP client - fulfils same role as cURL
    $client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
    
    // Send the request and get the response
    $response = $client->send($request)->getBody();
    
    // Decode the JSON
    $responseData = (string)json_decode($response);
    
    // Display the response. Imagine the JSON returned has a 'msg' field.
    echo "Response from API: &lt;strong&gt;{$response->msg}&lt;/strong&gt;";
</pre>
As we can see, this code sends a request to an API URL, passing in the access token, which is
sent in the HTTP header in the form:
<pre>Authorization: Bearer ab767c678de988f78...</pre>
</p>
<p>So that's it! The only thing we need to add is some error handling. You should wrap all the
code in the "else" block (i.e. if we have an authorisation code and valid state) inside a "try/catch"
block to handle errors thrown by the provider. e.g.
<pre>
try {
    // get access token if needed, and make your API calls
} catch(\League\OAuth2\Client\Provider\Exception\IdentityProviderException $e) { // thrown with invalid tokens
    echo "Exception: {$e->getMessage()}";
} catch(GuzzleHttp\Exception\ClientException $e) { // thrown if API returns an HTTP error code
    $status = $e->getResponse()->getStatusCode();
    echo $status==401 ? "This access token does not grant upload permission" :"HTTP error $status";
}
</pre>


<h2>Writing an OAuth server</h2>
<p>Often as a web developer you will only be interested in consuming other people's OAuth services.
However you may well be interested in how to develop an OAuth2 server yourself. We may return to this
in a future Wednesday Web session, but for now, here are a couple of pointers:
    <ul>
    <li><a href='https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client'>PHP OAuth2 Server</a> - well-maintained,
        updates in the past week.</li>
    <li><a href='https://github.com/oauthjs/node-oauth2-server'>Node OAuth2 Server</a> - interesting
    but has not seen any updates in more than a year.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>You are going to write an OAuth2 client to OpenTrailView (www.opentrailview.org) to allow
users to add tags to panoramas. To do this:
    <ul>
    <li>Login to Neptune with PuTTY. (The nature of this week's work means that we should not run out of
    disc space)</li>
    <li>Navigate to public_html (cd public_html)</li>
    <li>Install the oauth2-client with Composer:
    <pre>php ~vmadmin/composer.phar require league/oauth2-client</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Visit <em>opentrailview.org</em> and signup for an account. 
    Do not use a password that you use for Google, Facebook etc! I use password encryption and standard
    web security (HTTPS, data sanitisation/validation, SQL injection/XSS prevention, etc) but I don't 
    implement the extreme levels of security of a multi-million-dollar site so please use 
    a separate password.
    </li>
    <li>Login and register your app:
    <pre>https://www.opentrailview.org/addApp</pre>
    Make sure the callback URL points to a location on your space on Neptune and includes "index.php"!
    <strong>Note down your key and secret!</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Write the client as shown above. The API call you are going to make will be to tag a photo on
    OpenTrailView. <strong>Specifically, the code you should write is:</strong>
    <pre>  $request = $provider->getAuthenticatedRequest(
        'POST',
        'https://opentrailview.org/oauth/api/tag/add',
        $accessToken,
        ["headers"=>["Content-Type" => "application/json"],
        "body"=>json_encode(["tag"=>"some tag", "panoid"=>n])]
    );

    </pre>
    (<strong>where n is a number from 1-20, representing a panorama ID.</strong>)
    </li>
    <li>To check it worked, visit this URL:
    <pre>https://www.opentrailview.org/panorama/n</pre>
    where <strong>n</strong> is your chosen panorama ID.
    </li>
    <li>Adapt your client to read in the panorama ID and tag from a query string.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> try implementing an HTML form with method of POST on your client
    to allow the user to enter the panorama ID and tag.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
