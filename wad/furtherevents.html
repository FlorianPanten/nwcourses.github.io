<h1>Optional Extra Topic 10a: Further Event-Handling Topics: Key events and Timed Functions</h1>
<h2>Key events</h2>
<p>Key events occur when the user presses a key. With the growth of in-browser applications resembling traditional
desktop applications, handling key events is becoming more useful. Key events include <em>keydown</em>
(when the user presses a key down), <em>keypress</em> (when the user presses a key down and up immediately
as you normally would when typing) and <em>keyup</em> (when the user releases a key).  Here is an example
of using key events:
<pre>

// .js file

function init()
{
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    canvas.addEventListener ("keyup", handleKeyEvent);
}

function handleKeyEvent(e)
{
    console.log(`keyCode=${e.keyCode} shift?=${e.shiftKey}`);
}
</pre>
In the HTML, the canvas must have a <em>tabindex</em> attribute set to 0 (details below):
<pre>
&lt;canvas id='canvas1' width='400' height='400' <em>tabindex='0'</em>&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how we make use of two properties of the event object relating to key events, namely 
<em>keyCode</em> and <em>shiftKey</em>. <em>keyCode</em> gives us a numerical code (not necessarily the ASCII code)
for each key while <em>shiftKey</em> gives us a boolean (true/false) value representing whether the Shift key was
pressed or not. <em>keyCode</em> relates to the actual key, so pressing A or Shift/A will return the same value
(even though lower case 'a' and capital 'A' have different ASCII codes); we use <em>shiftKey</em> to determine
whether Shift was pressed at the same time. You can also use <em>ctrlKey</em> and <em>altKey</em> in the same
way, but use of CTRL and Alt during in browser applications is generally not used, as these keys have default
actions in the browser window itself.</p>
<p>Note also the use of <em>tabindex</em> in the canvas tag. 
(Ref: <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/accessibility_and_usability/elements_focusable_with_tabindex">
Jonathan Snook</a>). Normally, you cannot focus a canvas by clicking the
mouse or tabbing to it, because (unlike text fields, for example) they were not intended for text input.
Adding the attribute <em>tabindex</em> with a value of <em>0</em> (i.e. tabindex=0) to the canvas allows it to
be focused by clicking the mouse on it or tabbing to it. It also allows you to force focus in code using the
<em>focus()</em> method, for example:
<pre>canvas.focus();</pre>
</p>
<h2>Timed functions</h2>
<p>
In the kind of event-driven programming that we use with JavaScript, we might want to schedule a particular
action to occur at a fixed time interval. Imagine, for example, an in-browser game. The hero might move in response
to the arrow keys, but we need to make the monsters move independently and continuously without some sort of trigger
by the user (if the hero stands still the monsters will still need to chase). This can be done with the
<em>setInterval()</em> function. <em>setInterval()</em> is very easy to use: it takes two arguments, the function
we would like to run, and the interval to run it in milliseconds. For example (JavaScript only shown, not HTML:
we assume that there is a canvas with an ID of <em>canvas1</em>):
<pre>


var canvas, index;
var styles = ['black','blue','red','magenta','green','cyan','yellow','white'];


function init()
{
    canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    setInterval( doUpdate, 2000);
    index = 0;
}


function doUpdate()
{
    var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
    ctx.fillStyle = styles[index];
    ctx.fillRect(0,0,400,400);
    
    index++;
    if (index==styles.length)
    {
        index = 0;
    }
}

</pre>
Here we define a <em>doUpdate()</em> function. It fills the canvas with the current colour from the array
<em>styles</em> and then increases the index variable "count" by one, so that it moves on to the next colour
and once it's reached the end, it resets "count" to 0 again. We schedule this function to be called in the
<em>doUpdate()</em> function every 2000 milliseconds using <em>setInterval()</em>:
<pre>setInterval( doUpdate, 2000);</pre>
</p>
<h3>Starting and stopping a scheduled function</h3>
<p>At some point we will probably want to stop our scheduled function. We might also want to stop the user trying
to set a scheduled function going twice. To do these tasks we need to make use of the <em>return value</em> of
<em>setInterval()</em>, which is a "handle" on the function. We can then use <em>clearInterval()</em>, passing
the handle in as an argument, to stop the function being scheduled. Also, we can test whether the "handle"
already exists, to prevent the function being scheduled twice. The next example demonstrates this:
<pre>


var canvas, index;
var styles = ['black','blue','red','magenta','green','cyan','yellow','white'];
var handle;

function init()
{
    canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    document.getElementById("startbtn").addEventListener ("click", start);
    document.getElementById("endbtn").addEventListener ("click", end);
}

function start()
{
    if(handle)
    {
        alert("Function already scheduled!");
    }
    else
    {
        handle=setInterval(doUpdate, 2000);
        index = 0;
    }
}

function end()
{
    // Clear the function and set "handle" to null so that the test
    // in "start" will work and we'll be able to schedule the function
    // again.
    if(handle) 
    {
        clearInterval(handle);
        handle=null; 
    }
}

function doUpdate(n)
{
    var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
    ctx.fillStyle = styles[index];
    ctx.fillRect(0,0,400,400);
    
    index++;
    if (index==styles.length)
    {
        index = 0;
    }
}

</pre>
Note how we have two buttons, one to schedule the function and another to cancel it.
Note also how we test for the existence of the handle before starting the function,
to prevent the function being scheduled more than once which, if done enough times,
might crash the browser!
</p>
<h3>setTimeout()</h3>
<p>Very similar to <em>setInterval()</em> is <em>setTimeout()</em>. The only difference is that it
schedules a function to run just once, not multiple times.</p>
<h3>requestAnimationFrame()</h3>
<p>The <em>requestAnimationFrame()</em> function is similar in usage to
setInterval() but is designed to sync with the browser frame refresh and
can thus lead to smoother updates and animations. You pass it a function 
to call next time the display refreshes itself, resulting in smoother 
animations and less flicker. This function will typically perform a screen
update of some kind, such as an animation.</p>
<p>This function gets passed a parameter representing the current time since the page loaded in milliseconds. The function is only called once, so you need
to call requestAnimationFrame() again from within the function in order to
call it repeatedly. So you can use code such as:
<pre>

function init() {
    requestAnimationFrame(updateFunction);
}

function updateFunction(timeSincePageLoad) {
    // perform your animation...
    requestAnimationFrame(updateFunction);
}
</pre>
If you are doing an animation and you want to control the speed of movement
of a character across the screen so that it moves slower than 1 pixel per
requestAnimationFrame() call, you can increase its coordinates by a fractional
amount less than one. In fact, 
using the time parameter passed to the update function,
you can set the movement of a character to a specific number of pixels per
second, again leading to smoother and more consistent movement.
You can find information on requestAnimationFrame()
<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame'>here</a>.</p>
<h3>Further exercise</h3>
<p>Write code to move an image round the canvas. The user should use the arrow keys to move
it.
(key codes for the cursor
keys: 37=left, 38=up, 39=right, 40=down). If you do not have an image use this one:
<a href="https://edward2.solent.ac.uk/course/images/hero.png">hero.png</a>
</p>
<h2>Data URLs</h2>
<p>Most current browsers are able to understand <em>data URLs</em>. These are URLs representing data of some
sort, typically images although some browsers also understand data URLs of PDF documents. A data URL takes a form
such as:
<pre>
data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAZAAAAGQCAYAAACAvzb ... etc ...
</pre>
The image data is encoded in base64 (a text encoding of binary data such as image data). If you entered this
data URL in the address box of your browser, the corresponding image would be loaded.</p>
<h3>Uses of data URLs</h3>
<p>Data URLs are very useful when working with &lt;canvas&gt;. We might want to save the current state of the
canvas and restore it later. One example would be an in-browser Microsoft Paint-like application in which users can
draw on a canvas and save their drawing to an image element
(you cannot right-click on a canvas and save it directly as an image in all browsers). 
We can use the <em>toDataURL()</em> method of the canvas object to
do this. <em>toDataURL()</em> returns a data URL (by default in PNG format) of the contents of a canvas, for
example:
<pre>
function dataURLTest()
{
    var canvas = document.getElementById("canvas1");
    var dataURL = canvas.toDataURL();
    document.getElementById("img1").src = dataURL;
}
</pre>
What this code is doing is obtaining a canvas with an ID of <em>canvas1</em>, encoding its contents as a data
URL, and then setting the <em>src</em> property of the image with the ID of <em>img1</em> to the data URL.
The result will be that the contents of the canvas are copied into the image with the ID of <em>img1</em>, which the
user will be able to right-click to save.</p>
<h3>Loading a data URL back into a canvas</h3>
<p>You can also load a data URL back into a canvas. This is easy to do: simply create a new Image object, set its
<em>src</em> to the data URL, and draw it on the canvas. For example:
<pre>
var img = new Image();
img.src = dataURL; // where "dataURL" is the saved data URL
ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Data URLs and AJAX</h3>
<p>Data URLs are even more powerful when combined with AJAX. We can obtain the contents of a canvas as a data
URL and then send that data URL to a server-side script using AJAX. The server-side script can then decode the
data and save it server-side as a PNG image, making it possible to reload the image later.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what the client-side code might look like:
<pre>
var canvas;

function init()
{
    canvas = document.getElementById("canvas1");
    var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
    ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
    ctx.fillRect(0,0,400,400);
    ctx.fillStyle = 'green';
    ctx.fillRect(100,100,200,200);
    
    document.getElementById("btn1").addEventListener("click", ajaxsave);
}

function ajaxsave()
{
    var data = canvas.toDataURL().replace("data:image/png;base64,", "");
    var formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("imgdata", data);
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.addEventListener("load", e=&gt; { console.log('uploaded'); });
    xhr.open("POST", "saveimg.php");
    xhr.send(formData);
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>The client-side is fairly simple and includes little new: we get the data using <em>toDataURL()</em> and 
send it to the server-side script <em>saveimg.php</em> using AJAX. Note that:
<ul>
<li>we only want to send the actual base64 encoded data, not the URL part as the server does not need that.
    So we replace the URL part of the data URL (data:image/png;base64,) with a blank string before
    sending.</li>
<li>We use a POST request, not GET:
GET typically has a limitation on the amount of data which can be sent (and this is less than an encoded image)
and also conceptually GET implies that we are getting data while POST implies we are sending data.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Saving canvas data: server-side</h3>
<p>Here is what the server-side code to save this data might look like (note: no error-checking!):
<pre>
&lt;?php
$now = time();
$imgdata_encoded = str_replace(" ","+",$_POST["imgdata"]);
file_put_contents("/var/www/uploads/$now.png", base64_decode($imgdata_encoded));
?&gt;
</pre>
This code is a little more complex than you might expect, because there is a "gotcha" with 
POSTing data to a server. When POST requests are made, any + signs in the data are automatically
    converted to a space. This is because in URLs, plus signs are used to encode spaces.
    So we have to reverse the conversion by replacing any spaces with plus signs
    (base64 data never has any genuine spaces):
<pre>$imgdata_encoded = str_replace(" ","+",$_POST["imgdata"]);</pre>
</p>
<p>We then use <em>file_put_contents()</em> to put the file in a publicly-visible folder on the server.
Note also that we get the current time (in seconds since January 1st 1970) with <em>time()</em>, to ensure that
the saved file has a unique name.</p>
<br />
<h3>Advanced exercises</h3>
<h4>Either:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Develop your application above 
(in which you moved an image around the screen using the cursor keys)
into a simple game, 
in which the player has to avoid the chasing enemy
for as long as possible. To do this, you will need to write a function
to update the enemy's position to move it closer to the player, and
schedule it.<br />
To give you further practice with object-oriented programming in JavaScript,
you should create an object to represent a game character (player or enemy).
The object should have properties including x and y position, and, if you are using
an image, an appropriate Image object.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Or:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Develop an in-browser application which resembles Microsoft Paint.
Users should be able to scribble on a canvas and change colour
(via a series of coloured &lt;div&gt;s to allow the user to pick a colour).
If you have time, try
allowing users to pick a drawing tool (freehand, lines, rectangles, text, etc). </li>
<li>Using data URLs, try saving the image to the server.</li>
</ul>
