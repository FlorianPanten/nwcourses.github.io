<h1>Topic 5 - Implementing REST PUT and DELETE methods</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We have already seen how to write GET and POST methods in a Slim web service, and also how to send
GET and POST requests from a PHP client. However, you probably remember that REST uses two other methods
too: PUT and DELETE. How can we develop code to make use of these methods?</p>
<h2>Server side</h2>
<h3>DELETE request</h3>
<p>Handling DELETE requests with a Slim application is easy. 
We simply write <em>delete</em> and <em>put</em> routes in exactly the same way as we would
write <em>get</em> and <em>post</em> routes, by using the <em>delete</em> and <em>put</em> methods of our
<em>\Slim\App</em> object. For example:
<pre>
$app-&gt;delete('/flights/{id}', function ($req, $res, array $args) {
    $stmt = $this-&gt;db-&gt;prepare("DELETE FROM flights WHERE id=?");
    $stmt-&gt;bindParam (1, $args["id"]);
    $stmt-&gt;execute();
});
</pre>
This example sets up a DELETE route for the relative URL <em>/flights/{id}</em>, e.g. <em>/flights/45678</em>. If
this URL receives a DELETE request, the flight with the corresponding ID will be deleted from the database.</p>
<h3>PUT request</h3>
<p>With a PUT request, we need to send new data (typically as JSON) to our web service. Our web service then
needs to parse that JSON and use it to update the database. Note that calling 
<strong>getBody()-&gt;getContents();</strong> on the Request object will retrieve the contents of the body 
of the HTTP request:
<pre>
$app-&gt;put('/flights/{id}', function ($req, $res, array $args) {
    $put = json_decode(<strong>$req-&gt;getBody()-&gt;getContents()</strong>, true);
    $stmt = $this-&gt;db-&gt;prepare("UPDATE flights SET depart=?, arrive=?, price=? WHERE id=?");
    $stmt-&gt;execute(<strong>[$put["depart"], $put["arrive"], $put["price"], $args["id"]]</strong>);
});
</pre>
Note a couple of things about this example:
<ul>
<li>We use <strong>$req-&gt;getBody()-&gt;getContents()</strong> to obtain the body of the request.
With a PUT request, this will typically be JSON, so we parse it.</li>
<li>We prepare an UPDATE statement to update the data in the database.</li>
<li><strong>Also note how the PDO execute() now takes a 4-member array.</strong>
Unless you have come across it yourself, you have not seen this form of <em>execute()</em> before.
This array contains all the bound parameters for the prepared statement, i.e. the departure, arrival and price
from the JSON and the ID from the URL. This is used instead of four separate <em>bindParam()</em> methods
and is much more concise.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Client side</h2>
<p>Web services would normally be called from a client script or application,
for example with cURL. You have already seen how to use cURL to setup GET and POST requests. You can also
use cURL to send a DELETE request by adding the line:
<pre> curl_setopt($curl,CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, "DELETE");</pre>
PUT requests are a bit more difficult as you have to write a temporary file on your server 
and send that file over to the web service. To easily handle the different types of HTTP request in REST 
applications, I have written a wrapper function, <em>call_web_service()</em>,
with which you can easily make a request to a REST web service.
You can download it <a href='call_web_service.zip'>here (ZIP file)</a>; the source code is also viewable
online <a href='/~whiteleggn/call_web_service_v2.php.txt'>here</a>.
To use it in a script, you need to add the line:
<pre>
include('call_web_service.php');
</pre>
at the top of your script.
</p>
<p> With this script, to call any web service all you
need to do is:
<pre>$result = call_web_service( URL, method, data);</pre>
<ul>
<li><em>URL</em> is the URL of the web service;</li>
<li><em>method</em> is the method (e.g. PUT, DELETE);</li>
<li><em>data</em> is the data you're sending to the web service.
For example if you are using the PUT method to send a request to:
<pre>http://hittastic.com/song/1009</pre>
you would send some JSON to update the details of song 1009. 
This JSON would be parsed in our Slim web service as we saw in the PUT
example above.
</ul>
For example:
<ul>
<li>DELETE request:
<pre>
$result = call_web_service("https://edward2.solent.ac.uk/~pjones/flight/1009", "DELETE"); 
</pre>
This would send a DELETE request to the URL, causing flight 1009 to be deleted.</li>
<li>PUT request:
<pre>
$newData = [ "depart" =&gt; "0900", "arrive" =&gt; "1200", "price" =&gt; 200.0 ];
$result = call_web_service("https://edward2.solent.ac.uk/~pjones/flight/1009", "PUT", json_encode($newData)); 
</pre>
This would send a PUT request to the URL, causing flight 1009 to be modified. The associative array
<em>$newData</em> is encoded into JSON and sent within the body of the request. We then use the method
described in "Server side", above, to parse the data sent via the PUT request with Slim.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>What does call_web_service() return?</h3>
<p>The return value of call_web_service(), <em>$result</em> in the examples above, is an associative array containing 
the result returned from the web service. It contains two fields: 
    <ul>
    <li><em>$result["content"]</em> contains the JSON data returned from the web
    service;</li>
    <li><em>$result["code"]</em> contains the HTTP code returned from the
    web service. You can use this to test whether the web service operation
    was successful or not, and if not, why it wasn't successful.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add a <em>delete</em> route to your web service, to delete a review. The route should handle a URL such as:
<pre>/review/{id}</pre>
and delete the review with the given ID. </li>
<li>Add a <em>put</em> route to your web service, to update a review (text, star rating - note that the 
<em>reviews</em> table now has a <em>star_rating</em> column). JSON containing the new 
review and star rating should be read by the web service and used to update the review with the ID
specified in the URL.
Add error handling, so that if the review is blank, or the star rating is not between 1 and 5,
an appropriate HTTP code is returned.</li>
<li>Make sure you've done Exercise 3 from Topic 4. On the reviews page, add a link to delete a review.
This should link to an additional <em>client_review_delete.php</em> page which sends a DELETE request to the
web service and deletes the review.</li>
<li>Add an "Edit Review" </li> facility in your fan site. Users should be able to edit reviews and change
the star rating. As you should, by this stage, understand how to communicate with web services from your
fan site, I am not giving you full detail on how this should be implemented... but the user must be able to 
edit an existing review (show it in a text area) and star rating, and clicking an Edit button should result
in the review being edited. Check for errors returned from your update web service!</li>
</ol>
