<h1>GeoJSON</h1>
</div>
<p>This is an optional advanced topic on the <em>GeoJSON</em> data format,
which those of you who are ahead might want to look at.</p>
<h2>GeoJSON - introduction</h2>
<p><em><a href='http://www.geojson.org'>GeoJSON</a></em> 
is a relatively new format for representing geographical
data. As the name implies, it is based on 
JSON. It is typically supplied to clients by a 
web service; for instance, we might have a web service which supplies the 
location of points of interest close to a given latitude and longitude in
GeoJSON format. Because GeoJSON is JSON based, it is easily parsed by
JavaScript-based clients.</p>
<h2>The GeoJSON format</h2>
<p>GeoJSON consists of a series of objects. These are:
    <ul>
    <li><em>Features</em>: a feature represents a geographical feature, such
    as a road, a path, a pub or a restaurant. Each feature has a 
    <em>geometry</em> (see below) and a series of <em>properties</em>.</li>
    <li><em>Geometries</em>: a geometry is the representation of the 
    <em>shape</em> of the feature. For a point of interest, this would simply
    be a point (defined by latitude and longitude); for a more complex feature
    such as a road, a path or the outline of a building, it would be a series of
    points making up either a <em>LineString</em> (a linear series of points)
    or a <em>Polygon</em> (a series of points arranged in a loop). LineStrings
    would typically represent linear features such as roads or paths, while
    Polygons would represent features such as lakes, buildings or woods.</li>
    <li>a <em>FeatureCollection</em> is, as the name implies, a collection of
    features.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Here is an example of some GeoJSON.
<pre>
{
    type: "FeatureCollection":
    features:
    [
        {
            type: "Feature",
            geometry:
            {
                type: "Point",
                coordinates: [-1, 51]    
            },
            properties:
            {
                featureClass: "pub",
                name: "The Red Lion"
            }    
        },
        
        {
            type: "Feature",
            geometry:
            {
                type: "Point",
                coordinates: [-0.9, 51.1]
            },
            properties:
            {
                featureClass: "restaurant",
                name: "Sams Burger Joint"
            }
        },

        {
            type: "Feature",
            geometry:
            {
                type: "LineString",
                coordinates: [
                    [-1, 51],
                    [-1.01, 50.99],
                    [-1.01, 50.98],
                    [-1.02, 50.97],
                    [-1.04, 50.96]
                        ]
            },
            properties:
            {
                featureClass: "main road",
                number: "A987",
                name: "High Street"
            }
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
Note how this GeoJSON consists of a <em>FeatureCollection</em>. The
FeatureCollection in turn contains an array of <em>Feature</em> objects,
each of which contains three fields:
    <ul>
    <li>The <em>type</em>. This is just 'Feature', so that any client 
    application reading this GeoJSON is able to recognise that it's a
    feature;</li>
    <li>The <em>geometry</em>. This represents the actual points making up
    the feature. The geometry in turn has two fields, the <em>type</em>
    (e.g. Point, LineString, Polygon) and the <em>coordinates</em>. For
    a <em>Point</em>, the coordinates is simply an array with two members,
     the longitude and latitude respectively. For a <em>LineString</em>, the
    coordinates consists of an array of points, where each 
    point is itself a two-member array containing longitude and latitude.
    In other words, it is an array of arrays.</li>
    <li>The <em>properties</em>. This is a collection of variable/value
    pairs representing properties of the feature. In the road example
    above, there are three properties, the <em>featureClass</em> (main road),  
    <em>number</em> (A987) and <em>name</em> (High Street). Note that these
    are not keywords: you are free to choose the property names yourself.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Interpreting GeoJSON</h2>
<p>Interpreting GeoJSON is the same as interpreting any other type of JSON.
A client would typically send an AJAX request to a web service supplying
GeoJSON, and then evaluate the GeoJSON returned to load it into a JavaScript
variable, e.g. with <em>JSON.parse()</em> in standards-compliant browsers. 
We can then access
the GeoJSON collection using JavaScript syntax. For example, in an AJAX
callback:
<pre>
function responseReceived(e)
{
    var geojsonData=JSON.parse(e.target.responseText);
    alert(geojsonData.features[0].properties.name); // name of 1st feature

    //type of geometry of 1st feature
    alert(geojsonData.features[0].geometry.type);

    //longitude of 1st feature, assuming it's a point 
    alert(geojsonData.features[0].geometry.coordinates[0]); 

    //latitude of 1st feature, assuming it's a point 
    alert(geojsonData.features[0].geometry.coordinates[1]); 

    // longitude and latitude of 1st point of 3rd feature, assuming it's
    // a LineString
    alert(geojsonData.features[2].geometry.coordinates[0][0]); 
    alert(geojsonData.features[2].geometry.coordinates[0][1]); 
}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>GeoJSON from Leaflet</h2>
<p>If we are using Leaflet, however, it's easier than that. Leaflet comes
with GeoJSON parsing built-in. Within Leaflet, you can create a GeoJSON
Layer. With a GeoJSON layer, different types of GeoJSON feature will be
automatically added as a corresponding Leaflet layer type (marker, polyline
or polygon). So GeoJSON points will be added as Leaflet markers, and
GeoJSON polylines and polygons as Leaflet polylines and polygons.
Here is how to do this </p>
<p>First you add a GeoJSON layer in your init() function (note that
<em>geojsonLayer</em> would need to be a global variable, declared outside
of any function, so that the AJAX parsing function can access it):
<pre>
var geojsonLayer = L.geoJSON();
</pre>
<p> The marker 
(or polyline or polygon, depending on the
type of GeoJSON feature) is passed in to this anonymous function via the
<em>layer</em> parameter. The marker, polyline or polygon has a
<em>feature</em> property representing the GeoJSON feature. Using the
feature we can then access its <em>geometry</em> or <em>properties</em>
from JavaScript, so that, for example, 
<em>feature.properties.name</em> represents the <em>name</em> property
of the current feature.</p>
<p>The above code defines the GeoJSON
layer and defines how popups will appear, based on the feature's properties.
However, we also need to <em>actually add the features to the GeoJSON
layer</em>. This is typically done in an AJAX callback function, from an
AJAX call to a web service which provides data as GeoJSON.</p>
<p>
You loop through your GeoJSON features, and add them to your layer.
To do this you use the
<em>geojsonLayer.addData()</em> method, for example:
<pre>
function resultsReturned (e)
{
    var geojson = JSON.parse(e.target.responseText);
    for(var i=0; i&lt;geojson.features.length; i++)
    {
         geojsonLayer.addData(geojson.features[i]);
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>GeoJSON exercise</h2>
<p>On Edward2, at <em>https://edward2.solent.ac.uk/wad/restaurants.php</em> is a web service 
which 
generates GeoJSON of all restaurants within a given area
stored in the <em>restaurants</em> table in the
<em>dftitutorials</em> database. (This data is taken from OpenStreetMap,
data copyright OSM contributors, licenced under Open Database Licence).</p>
<p>This takes one query string parameter,
<em>bbox</em> (a bounding box). This consists of four values separated by
commas: the western, southern, eastern and northern bounds of the area to
query respectively. So if bbox is -1,51,0,52 for instance, only restaurants
between longitude -1 and longitude 0 (1 West and 0) and latitude 51
North and 52 North will be returned. To call the script and instruct it
to generate GeoJSON, use:
<pre>https://edward2.solent.ac.uk/wad/restaurants.php?bbox=west,south,east,north&amp;format=geojson
</pre>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect your Leaflet map from last time to this web service. In your
<em>init()</em> function, make an AJAX request to the web service; always
supply the bounding box -1.5, 50.8, -1.3, 50.9 (this is the local area). In
your AJAX callback, add each feature to the GeoJSON layer as shown above.</li>
<li>In Leaflet, you can get the current bounds of the visible area with 
the <em>getBounds()</em> method of L.Map. This gives you an
L.LatLngBounds object which
you can then query with the <em>getSouthWest()</em> and
<em>getNorthEast()</em> methods 
to obtain the SW and NE corners of the bounds. 
Each of these is an <em>L.LatLng</em> object from which you can obtain the
latitude and longitude. The following code retrieves these values into
four variables: west, south, east and north: 
<pre>
var west= map.getBounds().getSouthWest().lng;
var south= map.getBounds().getSouthWest().lat;
var east = map.getBounds().getNorthEast().lng;
var north= map.getBounds().getNorthEast().lat;
</pre>
You can also detect when a user stops dragging the map by reacting to the
<em>dragend</em> event, eg: 
<pre>
map.on("dragend", onDragEnd); 
</pre>
where onDragEnd would be a function to handle a drag end event.<br />
Use this to load all restaurants within the currently-displayed area
of the map when the user finishes dragging it.    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Adding popups to GeoJSON-derived features</h2>
<p>What would be useful is to display some information about the feature
when the user clicks the marker. </p>
<p>
You specify an <em>onEachFeature</em> function
when you <em>create your L.GeoJSON object</em>. The idea is that when a
GeoJSON feature is added to the GeoJSON layer, the function specified in the
<em>onEachFeature</em> property is called. Here is how this could be
done:
(the popup will remain hidden until the user clicks the feature)
<pre>
var geojsonLayer = new L.GeoJSON(null,
                {onEachFeature: feature,layer =&gt;
                    {
                        layer.bindPopup("Name=" + feature.properties.name);
                    }
                }
            );
</pre>
Note that this is an arrow function, which you first encountered in the
AJAX topic. The function is automatically supplied with two parameters,
<em>feature</em>, the GeoJSON feature we are adding, and <em>layer</em>,
the marker we are adding the feature too. So
<em>feature.properties</em>
will contain the <em>properties</em> of the feature.
So, the effect of this code is to 
attach a popup to the layer (the marker)
associated with the feature, containing the feature's name.</p>
<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add popups to your features from the previous exercise, containing the
feature's name.</li>
<li><em>Advanced, for students comfortable with programming only:</em>
One problem with the approach so far is that markers are added every
time the user drags to a new area, even if the marker has already been added
when a user previously visited that area. You can get round this by creating
an array of references to each feature, using the feature's ID as the array
index (in JavaScript you can use non-consecutive array indices), and only
adding the marker if there is not already a marker with that index in the
array. The ID of each feature is contained within the GeoJSON.
You would use code of this form; here, the variable <em>indexedFeatures</em>
references each feature by ID.
<pre>
for(var i=0; i&lt;geojson.features.length; i++)
{
    var id=geojson.features[i].properties.id;
    if (!indexedFeatures[id])
    {
        indexedFeatures[id] = geojson.features[i]; 
        geojsonLayer.addData(geojson.features[i]);
    }
}
</pre>
Implement this. The GeoJSON contains a record of each feature's ID.
You will need to make the array global, so that any function can access it, and
create memory for the array in your <em>init()</em> function with:
<pre>indexedFeatures=new Array();</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exercise 3: creating your own GeoJSON feed</h2>
<p>On Edward2, under the <em>dftitutorials</em> database,  there is a table 
called <em>restaurants</em> representing restaurants. It contains 
<em>lat</em>, <em>lon</em>, and <em>name</em> columns.
    <ol>
    <li>Write a script which generates a GeoJSON feed from this table. It 
    should take one query string parameter, <em>bbox</em>, containing 
    the bounds of the area to generate the feed from, as a comma 
    separated list : west,south, east, north. You can extract the 
    individual variables from this parameter using the following PHP
    statement:
    <pre>list($w,$s,$e,$n) = explode(",", $_GET["bbox"]);</pre>
    This "explodes" the bbox variable into an array (the comma is the
    separator character), and <em>list()</em> then extracts the four
    elements of the array into the variables $w, $s, $e and $n.</li>
    <li>Connect to this feed from your Leaflet map (this should simply
    be a case of switching the URL)</li>
    </ol>
