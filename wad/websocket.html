<h1>Topic 19: Introduction to WebSocket</h1>
</div>
<h2>Real-time Updates</h2>
<p>Really interactive, real-time web applications feature 
<em>real-time updates</em>.
For instance, real-time chat applications update with messages contributed by
any user in the chat, or a real-time train map needs to be updated which each 
train's current position.
</p> 
<p>We can implement these real-time applications using the technologies we already
know through the use of <em>polling</em>, in which we schedule an AJAX
request to be sent to the server every so often (every 5 seconds, every
minute, etc). However this has the disadvantage that if we want frequent
updates, we have to either 
send a message to the server very frequently, potentially
overloading the server (and this would be wasteful if the data is not changing)
or send it less frequently, meaning updates would not truly be real-time.</p>

<h3>Push Technology</h3>

<p>What we need instead is <em>push technology</em>. Normal HTTP requests
are <em>pull</em> requests: they <em>pull</em> data from the server.
<em>Push</em> requests, however, involve the server sending messages to
the client <em>without receiving a request</em>. <em>WebSocket</em> is
a protocol which allows servers to send push requests to clients.</p>

<h3>How does WebSocket work?</h3>
<p>WebSocket has a detailed specification available
<a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455'>here</a> which explains it
in detail; <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_Servers'>this Mozilla article</a> also goes into some detail
and is easier to understand than the full specification. But to summarise:
    <ul>
    <li>A <em>WebSocket server</em> runs as an independent process, on an
    independent port (typically 8080), to Apache.</li>
    <li>A <em>WebSocket client</em>, running in the browser and typically
    written in JavaScript, listens to requests coming in from the WebSocket
    server and can send messages back. Similarly, the WebSocket server can
    listen to, and respond to, messages coming from the client.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Writing a WebSocket client</h3>
<p>Writing a WebSocket client is quite easy because JavaScript provides
native support. Here is an example:
<pre>
function init() {
    var ws = new WebSocket('ws://example.com:8080');
    
    ws.onopen = e =&gt; {
        //Handle the web socket being opened...
        alert('Websocket was opened!');
        ws.send('ephp001');
    }

    ws.onmessage = e =&gt; {
        console.log('Websocket sent back... ' + e.data);
    }

    ws.onerror = e =&gt; {
        alert('Error with websocket communication: is the server running?');
    }
}
</pre>
Note how we create a <em>WebSocket</em> object and 
specify the server and port (example.com and 8080 respectively,
here). We then specify three different event handlers:
    <ul>
    <li><em>onopen</em> - this event handler will run when the connection
    to the web socket is made. In this example we use the <em>send()</em>
    method of the WebSocket object to send a username back to the server
    (so that, as soon as we have connected to the server, we let the server
    know who we are).
    JSON is typically used as a format to transmit data between client
    and server.</li>
    <li><em>onmessage</em> - this event handler will run when the client
    receives a push message from the server. The <em>data</em> property of
    the event object will contain the data sent back. Here, we just display
    it on the console.</li>
    <li><em>onerror</em> - this will run if an error of some kind occurs.
    Typical errors include the server not running, or the port being blocked
    by a firewall.</li>
    </ul>
</p> 

<h3>Writing a WebSocket server</h3>
<p>
Various server side languages can deal with websockets using third party
libraries. Here is an example with the <em>ws</em> module in Node.
</p>
<pre>
const wsock = require('ws');
const server = new wsock.Server({port:8080});

// When the server receives a new connection...
server.on('connection', clientConn=&gt; {
    console.log('New connection');

    // Listen for messages from this connection...
    clientConn.on('message', msg=&gt; {
        console.log(`Received a message: ${msg}`);

        server.clients.forEach ( curClient=&gt; {
            curClient.send(msg);
        });
    });
});
</pre>
Note how we:
    <ul>
    <li>Create a new web socket server and listen on port 8080.</li>
    <li>Handle the 'connection' event. This occurs when a new client 
    connects to the web socket server.</li>
    <li>Inside the 'connection' event handler, set up an event handler for
    receiving messages from this client (the 'message' event handler)</li>
    <li>Inside the 'message' event handler, process messages received. The
    <em>msg</em> parameter will be the message sent from the client. In this
    example, every time we receive a message, we loop through the collection
    of currently-connected clients (<em>server.clients</em>) and send the
    message received to each one (using the client's <em>send()</em> method).
    </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>Write a simple chat application, similar to the one demonstrated in 
class. To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a web page with a text field to add a message, and a div to
show all messages so far. The message should be sent to the web socket 
server when a button is clicked. 
Upload this to your public_html folder on Neptune. 
</li>
<li>Write a corresponding websocket server and upload this to your personal
directory. A div should update each
time <em>anyone</em> sends a new message, as above.</li>
<li>Run your websocket server from the Neptune console.</li>
<li>
Enhance your application so that it works like a real chat system;
each time a new message is sent back from the server, the user who wrote that
message should be displayed. To do this you will need a user ID field in
the front end and send the user ID with the chat message. Send a JSON
message with two fields, one for the user ID and one for the chat message;
you can use <em>JSON.stringify()</em> to encode a JavaScript object as 
JSON.</li>
<li><strong>ADVANCED:</strong> you can avoid having to send the user ID each
time as follows. The <em>clientConn</em> object is just a plain JavaScript
object, so you can add properties to it.
    <ol>
    <li>Users should have to login first, by specifying a user ID and clicking
    a button. The user ID will then be sent to the server. Note that you
    should send it as a piece of JSON data including a message type field,
    so that the server can tell that this is a user ID and not a chat 
    message. When the server receives this message, attach the username to the
    current <em>clientConn</em> as a property, e.g.
    <pre>clientConn.user = msgData.user;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>When the user sends a chat message, this should be again sent as
    JSON so that the server can tell that it is a chat message and not a
    user ID.</li>
    <li>Work out which user sent the chat message. This can be done using
    the property of the clientConn object (current client connection) that
    you set in step 1.</li>
    </ol>
</li>
</ol>
