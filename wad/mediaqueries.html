<h1>CSS Media Queries</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Reference: <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Media_queries'>Mozilla developer page</a></em></p>
<p><em>CSS Media Queries</em> allow us to define different stylesheets, or stylesheet rules, depending on the
properties of the device. In this way, we can develop sites which have a usable layout on both a desktop browser
and a mobile browser. Media queries test different properties of the current device (such as the width or aspect
ratio), and depending on whether the
properties are true or false, can apply different CSS rules. Thus we can design different layouts for desktop and
mobile devices.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using media queries to load a different stylesheet based on the width of the device:
<pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (max-width: 599px)" type="text/css" href="mobile.css" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (min-width: 600px)" type="text/css" href="desktop.css" /&gt;
</pre>
Note the media query, specified in the <em>media</em> property of the <em>link</em> tag. This code
is telling the browser to include the stylesheet <em>mobile.css</em> if it is a screen-based device (as opposed to a printer,
for instance) and the width of the screen is 599 pixels or less, or to include the stylesheet <em>desktop.css</em> if
it is a screen-based device and the width of the screen is 600 pixels or more. So for a typical smartphone the first 
stylesheet will be linked in, and for a typical desktop browser the second stylesheet will be included.</p>
<p>When we say <em>width</em>, we mean the width of the <em>browser viewport</em>, i.e. the currently visible area of the browser window in which the page content is displayed. We do not mean the width of the device itself. This has the advantage
that the "mobile" layout will apply if we resize the window of a regular desktop browser below 600 pixels - which is probably
what we want.</p>
<h3>Different media types</h3>
<p>As well as <em>screen</em>, there are other media types such as <em>aural</em>, <em>braille</em> or <em>print</em>,
for different types of devices. These three are for screen readers (which speak the contents
of a web page), braille-based browsers, and printers, respectively.</p>
<h3>Other CSS Media Query directives</h3>
<p>Besides <em>max-width</em> and <em>min-width</em>, a range of other useful CSS media query rules exist. They 
include:
    <ul>
    <li><em>max-device-width</em> and <em>min-device-width</em>. These specify the maximum and minimum width of
    <em>the entire device</em>, rather than the viewport, as described in <em>max-width</em> and
    <em>min-width</em> above.  So, if you were to
    use <em>max-device-width</em> and <em>min-device-width</em> you could use one stylesheet for mobile devices and another
    for desktop browsers, the desktop stylesheet being applied even if you resized the browser window on a desktop
    machine to a narrow width.</li>
    <li><em>Aspect ratio</em> rules. These relate to the aspect ratio of the viewport or the device, in other words the
    width divided by the height. This allows certain layouts to be applied to landscape screens (those where the width
    is greater than the height) and
    others to portrait screens (where the height is greater than the width). The aspect ratio rules include:
        <ul>
        <li><em>aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio</em>: the aspect ratio of the viewport and the device itself
        (use above for the difference between the viewport and the device). Use these if you want a stylesheet for
        a <em>specific</em> aspect ratio. These are expressed as fractions, e.g.:
        <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="only screen and (aspect-ratio: 3/2)" href="style.css" /&gt;
        </pre></li>
        <li><em>max-aspect-ratio</em>, <em>min-aspect-ratio</em>, <em>max-device-aspect-ratio</em> and
        <em>min-device-aspect-ratio</em>. These allow you to specify the maximum or minimum aspect ratio for a particular
        style. What do "maximum" and "minimum" mean? Since aspect ratio is width divided by height, it follows that the
        greater the width is relative to the height, the higher the aspect ratio. So a <em>max-aspect-ratio</em> of 
        <em>3/2</em>. e.g:
        <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="only screen and (max-aspect-ratio: 3/2)" href="style.css"/&gt;
        </pre>, would apply the stylesheet if the width is 1.5 times the height or less.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><em>orientation</em>: a shortcut for the aspect ratio rules above. This can have the values "portrait" or
    "landscape" and will link a particular stylesheet if the device is in landscape or portrait orientation respectively.
    For example:
    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="only screen and (orientation: portrait)" href="portrait.css"/&gt;
    </pre>
    </li>
    <li><em>color</em>, <em>min-color</em> and <em>max-color</em> - used to specify different stylesheets for different 
    colour depths. <em>color</em> on its own will apply the stylesheet if it is a colour device while <em>min-color</em>
    and <em>max-color</em> will apply the stylesheet if the colour depth is at least, or at most, a given number of bits
    of colour. So for example:
    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="only screen and (min-color:24)" href="highcolour.css"/&gt;</pre>
    would only apply the stylesheet <em>highcolour.css</em> if the device had at least 24-bit colour.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Combining conditions</h3>
<p>You can combine conditions with the use of <em>and</em> and <em>not</em> operators, for example, this will only
link in the stylesheet if the width of the viewport is at least 800 pixels <em>and</em>
there are at least 24 bits of colour:
<pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="only screen and (min-width: 800px) and (min-color: 24)"
 href="desktop.css" /&gt;
 </pre>
 or this will link in the stylesheet if the viewport is <em>not</em>
at least 800 pixels (i.e. less than 800 pixels)
 but the colour depth is at least 24:
 <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="only screen and (not min-width: 800px) and (min-color: 24)"
 href="mobile.css" /&gt;
 </pre>
 </p>
 <p>There is not an "or" operator but you can separate criteria with a comma and the stylesheet will be applied if any
 of the media are met, e.g:
 <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="only screen and (min-width: 800px), 
only screen and (min-color:24)" href="style.css" /&gt;
 </pre>
 would apply the stylesheet if <em>either</em> the width is at least 800 pixels 
 <em>or</em> the colour is at least 24-bit.
 </p>
 <h3>Media Queries and individual CSS rules</h3>
 <p>The examples so far have shown how to link in whole stylesheets depending on the properties of the device. However in
 certain cases we might just want to incorporate <em>certain rules (selectors)</em> within the CSS
 depending on the device properties, for example the dimensions of a specific <em>div</em>. Here is how to do this in a CSS stylesheet:
 <pre>
 @media only screen and (min-width: 800px)
 {
    #div1 
    {
        width: 800px;
        height: 600px;
    }
    
    #div2 
    {
        width: 800px;
        height: 400px;
    }
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) 
{
    #div1
    {
        width: 320px;
        height: 200px;
    }
    
    #div2 
    {
        width: 320px;
        height:200px;
    }
}
 </pre>
 The first pair of rules will be applied if the width is at least 800 pixels, and the second, if the width is no more
 than 480 pixels. Note how we specify the media rule and then use curly brackets { and } to define the block of CSS
 which applies to this media rule. Within this outer block we list one or more CSS selectors (rules)
 which will be applied if the media rule holds true.</p>
 
 
 <h2>The problem with high resolution mobile devices</h2>

<p><em>Please note, the following two references provide much additional information about this topic:

<ul>
<li><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag'>Mozilla dev article</a></li>
<li><a href='https://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports2.html'>Peter-Paul Koch, quirksmode.org, "A Tale Of Two Viewports", Part 2</a></li>
</ul>

</em>
</p>


<p>CSS media queries as above are fine for "classic" mobile devices with low
resolution, but we come across a problem when trying to develop for modern,
high resolution devices. This problem relates to the concept of the <em>viewport</em>. You might think
"viewport" means the same as "screen" but in fact, this is not the case.
</p>
<p>As Koch discusses in his article, there are actually <em>two</em> viewports. The first
is the screen (also known as the 'device viewport' 
(<a href='https://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports2.html'>Koch</a>)) and the sceond is the
'layout viewport' (<a href='https://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports2.html'>Koch</a>). The layout viewport is the actual area on whch the page is
rendered, and does not necessarily equal the screen size.
 For a mobile device the width of the layout viewport depends on the browser: "How wide is the layout viewport? That 
differs per browser.  Safari iPhone uses 980px, Opera 850px, Android WebKit 800px, and IE 974px."
(<a href='https://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports2.html'>Koch</a>).
This may well exceed the width of the actual
device viewport (screen), which means that parts of the page would, if nothing else was done, 
go off-screen, severely impacting usability.
</p>

<p>Mobile browsers typically deal with this <em>automatically</em> deal with this by shrinking (zooming out) the page so 
that the layout viewport matches the device viewport. While at least we can see the page on-screen without parts of it disappearing off
the right-hand side, this results in another problem - the page is too small on a mobile 
device, and thus is unreadable and has very poor usability. Furthermore, media queries use the layout viewport, not the device viewport,
so, for example, on an Android device with a screen width of <em>less than</em> 800px, media queries designed for less-than-800px widths will
<em>not</em> apply as the <em>layout</em> viewport is still 800.</p>
 
<p>So how can we deal with this? What we can do is <em>set the layout viewport to have the same width as the device 
viewport</em> and then  <em>use media queries to design an appropriate mobile layout</em>.</p>

<p>To do the first, we can add this <em>meta</em> tag to our page (in the &lt;head&gt; section):
<pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /&gt;</pre>
This line is setting the size of the <em>layout viewport</em> and it's fixing its width to be
<em>device-width</em>, which is the actual width of the device (screen) in <em>CSS pixels</em> (see below).</p>

<h3>CSS pixels</h3>

<p>An understanding of <em>CSS pixels</em> helps understanding of what is going on here.
What are CSS pixels? These are 'virtual pixels' which are used by CSS rules.
But what is one CSS pixel equivalent to? Normally 1 CSS pixel is equivalent to 1 "actual" pixel but this changes on 
performing zoom operations. So when you zoom in a page (for example, using Ctrl/+ on a desktop), CSS pixels grow larger to occupy more 
space than one real pixel. However if you zoom out (Ctrl.-), CSS pixels become smaller and one CSS pixel
will occupy less space than one real pixel.</p>

<p>To give some actual examples, a page element scaled to 800 CSS pixels will occupy 800 'real' pixels at default zoom.
However, if we zoom IN by a factor of 1.5, the element will occupy more screen space - 1200 'real' pixels.
Its width in *CSS* pixels, though, will remain 800 so nothing will change in terms of which media query rules are
matched. So in this example one CSS pixel will occupy 1.5 real pixels.
</p>
<p>However, if we zoom OUT by a factor of 2, the page will occupy LESS screen space. So its width in 'real' pixels will now
be 400 but it will still be 800 <strong>CSS</strong> pixels so nothing changes in terms of which media query rules are
matched. So in this example one CSS pixel will occupy 0.5 real pixels.</p>

<p>The <strong>width: device-width, initial-scale : 1</strong> in the directive above:
<pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /&gt;</pre>
forces the width of the page (in CSS pixels) to be the same
as the width of the device in CSS pixels with no zoom applied (i.e. the width 
of the device in 'real' 
pixels). So here, the page will use, not 800 CSS pixels of width, but 640, by default (as that is the
width of the page) - and media queries designed
for devices with a width of less than 800 CSS pixels will kick in.

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>Develop your web mapping example to use a sidebar/main content area layout. The sidebar should
contain links to OpenStreetMap (www.openstreetmap.org), OpenCycleMap (www.opencyclemap.org) and Freemap
(www.free-map.org.uk). Use: sidebar width 20%, main content width 80%,e.g:
<pre>
#sidebar
{
    position:absolute;
    top:0%;
    left:0%;
    width:20%;
    height:100%
}

#main
{
    position:absolute;
    top:0%;
    left:20%;
    width:80%;
    height:100%
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Use CSS media queries so that a different layout is produced when the screen width is 480 pixels or less. This
alternative layout should have a map of width 480 pixels, height 200 pixels and should show the copyright message and
the three links immediately
above the map, so that everything is in one column, not two. The width of the
sidebar (now top bar) should be 100%.
 This "narrower" layout is more mobile-friendly. 
<strong>Do not use position: absolute or set the top or left properties.</strong> Just let the elements flow in natural order.</li>
<li>Change your answer so that the first layout appears if the aspect ratio is greater than 2/3, and the second layout if
the aspect ratio is less than 2/3.</li>
<li>Ensure the viewport is set so that the site looks friendly on a high-resolution mobile device.</li>
