<h1>Topic 10: Introduction to Canvas and Event Handling</h1>
<p>This topic is only intended for students who are up-to-date. You must 
complete Topics 1-4, and 6-8,before you attempt this.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Canvas</h2>

<p>The <em>canvas</em> tag allows you to draw 2D graphics in the browser.
It has only been available for the past 10 years or
so of web development. It was not available in the first 10 to 15 years of
the web; at that time people had to rely on proprietary third-party plugins
such as Flash which were awkward to install and keep up to date.</p>
<p>It allows you to draw shapes such as lines,
rectangles, circles, polygons and curves - as well as text - within the
browser. This opens up a number of possibilities including in-browser
drawing applications or even games.</p>
<h2>Using the canvas tag</h2>
<p><strong>Note that to allow you time to do practical work</strong>, I will
not go through <em>all</em> of these notes in detail. However they are there
for you to read.</p>
<h3>How do you create a canvas?</h3>

<p> Simply add a &lt;canvas&gt; tag to your HTML and give it an ID, a 
width and a height (specify the width and height here, and <em>not</em>
in the CSS, otherwise the drawing functions will not work correctly)
e.g.:
<pre>&lt;canvas id='canvas1' width='500' height='500'&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>
</p>
<h3>How do you draw things on a canvas?</h3>
<p>You use JavaScript to actually draw on the canvas. Here is a short
example which draws a red rectangle. This example only will show the full
HTML as well as the JavaScript, but subsequent examples will show the
JavaScript only as the HTML remains the same:
<pre>

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='canvas.js&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body onload='init()'&gt;
&lt;canvas id='canvas1' width='400' height='400'&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
JavaScript:
<pre>
function init()
{
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.fillStyle = '#ff0000'; // red 
    ctx.fillRect(10,10,100,100);
}
</pre>
What we do in this script is as follows:
<pre>
var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
</pre>
This gets hold of the canvas element using the DOM.
<pre>
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
</pre> 
This line obtains a <em>drawing context</em> from the canvas. The drawing 
context is an object we use to draw on the canvas.
<pre>
ctx.fillStyle = '#ff0000'; // red 
ctx.fillRect(10,10,100,100);
</pre>
These lines set the fill colour to red and draw a red rectangle at x=10, y=10
of width 100 and height 100 pixels. Here is another example which shows
an outline-only, non-filled-in rectangle:
<pre>
function init()
{
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.strokeStyle = '#0000ff'; // blue
    ctx.strokeRect(10,10,100,100);
}
</pre>
Note how this example sets the stroke (i.e. line drawing) colour instead of
the fill colour, and draws an outlined rectangle with
<em>strokeRect()</em>.
</p>
<h4>Paths (lines and polygons)</h4>
<p>We can draw polygons and multi-point lines by creating a <em>path</em>.
Here is an example:
<pre>
function init()
{
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.strokeStyle = '#0000ff'; // blue
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(100,100);
    ctx.lineTo(150,100);
    ctx.lineTo(150,150);
    ctx.stroke();
}
</pre>
Here is an explanation of the new functions:
    <ul>
    <li>ctx.beginPath() - this begins a new path (by path, we mean a sequence
    of points making up a line or polygon);</li>
    <li>ctx.moveTo() - this moves the drawing position to the specified
    coordinates (but does not actually draw anything);</li> 
    <li>ctx.lineTo() - this creates a line from the previous drawing position,
    specified by <em>moveTo()</em> or <em>lineTo()</em>, to the specified
    coordinates. Note it doesn't actually draw the line - it just
    creates it in memory. We need <em>ctx.stroke()</em> to actually draw
    the line.</li>
    <li>ctx.stroke() - actually renders the line.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>We could turn it into a polygon, rather than a line, with the addition of
the following line immediately before the <em>ctx.stroke()</em>:
<pre>ctx.closePath();</pre>
This line effectively "closes the loop".</p>
<p>We could also draw a <em>filled polygon</em> by substituting
<em>ctx.stroke()</em> with <em>ctx.fill()</em>.</p>

<h4>Text</h4>
<p>Here is an example which draws text.
<pre>
function init()
{
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.font = '12pt Helvetica';
    ctx.fillText('Hello', 300, 300);
}
</pre>
This should hopefully be obvious: the font is set to 12pt Helvetica and then
the text 'Hello' is drawn at x=300, y=300.</p>
<h4>Images</h4>
<p>This example draws images. (see 
<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/canvas-tutorial/3_1_canvas_drawimage.html'>
here</a>).
<pre>
function init()
{
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    var image = new Image();
    image.src = "http://server.com/images/hero.png";
    image.addEventListener("load", () =&gt; {
        ctx.drawImage(image, 100, 100);
    });
}
</pre>
Note how we create a new Image object, set its <em>src</em> property to the location of
the image on the server, and then draw the image at a given x and y 
position. Note the <em>image.addEventListener("load", ...)</em> 
which links to an arrow function which actually draws the image. Why are we 
doing this? Loading an image from
the web might take time, so writing our code this way ensures that the image
will only be drawn once it's been loaded.</p>
<h4>Circles</h4>
<p>We can also draw circles, here is an example:
<pre>
function init()
{
    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1');
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ctx.strokeStyle = '#0000ff'; // blue
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(100, 100, 50, 0, Math.PI*2, false);
    ctx.stroke();
}
</pre>
The 6 parameters to <em>arc()</em> need to be explained as many are not
obvious. The reason why there are so many is because
the function can be used to draw arcs as well as circles. Here is the
explanation:
    <ul>
    <li>The first three parameters (100, 100 and 50 here) are the x and y
    position and the radius.</li>
    <li>The fourth and fifth are the starting and ending values to draw an
    arc. If you imagine a circle, imagine the top of the circle is 0 
    radians (0 degrees),
    the right-hand side PI/2 radians (90 degrees), 
    the bottom PI radians (180 degrees) and the left-hand
    side 1.5*PI radians (270 degrees). The start and end values describe how
    much of the circle we draw. Here, we have
     the start and end point 0 and PI*2 radians (360 degrees), so the whole
    circle is drawn.</li>
    <li>The final parameter represents whether the arc is drawn clockwise 
    (false) or anticlockwise (true).</li>    
    </ul>
Once again we can use <em>fill()</em> to draw a filled circle, or arc, rather
than <em>stroke()</em>.
</p>
<h2>Event handling</h2>

<p>As we have already seen, <em>event handling</em> is a common technique in client-side web development. 
An <em>event</em> 
typically occurs when the user interacts with a page in some way, such as clicking a button or moving the
mouse over a <em>div</em>. We have already seen some examples of events with
map click events and button click events; indeed events can be classed in 
the general sense as things that happen outside the main flow of the program,
in other words they require asynchronous code.
Receiving an AJAX response, or obtaining a GPS signal, are other examples of
events. We write <em>callback functions</em>
to handle the various types of event; these callback functions are 
known as <em>event handlers</em>.</p>
<p>The modern way of linking an event to its handler is via the <em>addEventListener()</em> method, which
you have already seen. This
takes two arguments, the event type and the event handler function. For example:
<pre>element.addEventListener("eventtype", eventHandler);</pre>
For example, to handle a click event we would say:
<pre>element.addEventListener("click", eventHandler);</pre>
where <em>eventHandler</em> is a function which runs when the user clicks on the given element. 
</p>
<h3>The event object</h3>
<p>In the event handler we need to find out 
<em>information about the event</em>. Useful information about the event might include:
    <ul>
    <li>What page element was clicked on?</li>
    <li>What mouse button was clicked or what key was pressed?</li>
    <li>What is the current position of the mouse on the page, or on the element
    that was clicked</li>
    </ul>
We can find out all this information via the <em>event object</em>. The event object is a special object
automatically sent to an event-handler function by JavaScript as the first argument. Here is an example of how
you can use the event object with mouse events:
<pre>

// init() runs when the page first loads
function init()
{
    // Obtain an element
    var canvas1 = document.getElementById("canvas1");

    // Handle mouse down, mouse move and mouse up events

    // The mouseDownHandler function will handle mouse presses
    canvas1.addEventListener ("mousedown", mouseDownHandler);

    // The mouseMoveHandler function will handle mouse movement
    canvas1.addEventListener ("mousemove", mouseMoveHandler);

    // The mouseUpHandler function will handle mouse release
    canvas1.addEventListener ("mouseup", mouseUpHandler);
}

function mouseDownHandler(e)
{
    console.log(`mouse pressed down at local coordinates: ${e.offsetX}, ${e.offsetY}`);
}

function mouseMoveHandler(e)
{
    console.log(`mouse moved at local coordinates: ${e.offsetX}, ${e.offsetY}`);
}

function mouseUpHandler(e)
{
    console.log(`mouse released at local coordinates: ${e.offsetX}, ${e.offsetY}`);
}

</pre>
Note how the three event handlers, <em>mouseDown()</em>, <em>mouseMove()</em> and <em>mouseUp()</em> all have
one parameter, <em>e</em>, which is the event object. This example uses two properties of the event object,
<em>offsetX</em> and <em>offsetY</em>, which represent the current x and y position of the mouse
<em>with respect to the element it is currently over</em> (e.g. a canvas).</p>
<p>Other properties of the event object include:
    <ul>
    <li><em>e.keyCode</em>: the key pressed - not necessarily equivalent to the ASCII
    codes;</li>
    <li><em>e.button</em>: the mouse button pressed;</li>
    <li><em>e.target</em>: the page element which was clicked on (i.e. the "target" of the event). This can be used, for example, to attach the same event 
listener to several page elements and then only perform an action on the element that was clicked.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
