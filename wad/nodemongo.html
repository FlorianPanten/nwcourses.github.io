<h1>Topic 15: node.js and MongoDB</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
node.js works very well with MongoDB. As you saw last time, MongoDB uses a JavaScript-like syntax
to query the database. This means that there is quite a close resemblance between MongoDB
query syntax and querying a MongoDB database from Node.
</p>

<h2>Using MongoDB from node.js</h2>
<p>There are a couple of options for using MongoDB from Node:
    <ul>
    <li>Use the standard <em>mongodb</em> module;</li>
    <li>Use <em>Mongoose</em>. Mongoose is a higher-level API which makes
    the process of querying a MongoDB database simpler and friendlier. It
    also allows you to define <em>schemas</em> for your MongoDB collections;
    when an item is added, any fields not in the schema will be
    ignored.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Mongoose has a website <a href='http://mongoosejs.com'>here</a>. The
website contains extensive tutorials and documentation.</p>

<h3>Connecting to the database</h3>
<p>Here is how you connect to the database using Mongoose:
<pre>
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Connect to a database named 'test' on the local machine (localhost)
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');

// Run a callback as soon as the connection is open
mongoose.connection.once('open', ()=&gt; {
    // do your queries in this callback...
});
</pre>
Note how we open a connection to the 'test' database on the local machine
(localhost) and specify a callback to run as soon as the connection has been
opened. This is a similar approach to the MySQL API which we looked at last
week.</p>
<h3>Defining a model and a schema</h3>
<p>Mongoose uses the concepts of <em>models</em> and <em>schemas</em>.
A <em>model</em> is a JavaScript object acting as an interface to your
collection; it's the same concept as the model in MVC. Here is an example
of creating a model representing documents in a <em>students</em>
collection:
<pre>
const Student = mongoose.model('student', new mongoose.Schema(
        { firstname: String,
            lastname: String,
            course: String,
               grade: Number} )); 
</pre>
Our model object is <em>Student</em>. We create it using the
<em>mongoose.model()</em> method which takes two arguments:
    <ul>
    <li>The MongoDB collection that it maps to, in the singular (i.e. if
    the collection name is <em>students</em>, we use <em>student</em>).</li>
    <li>A <em>mongoose.Schema</em> object representing the schema. This is
    a schema in the normal database sense, i.e. a description of properties
    (fields) and data types. Here, we have four fields:  name,
    course and grade.  These are all Strings; we can also have Numbers.
    Note that by default the <em>_id</em> will be automatically allocated
    a unique <em>ObjectId</em>. 
    See <a href='https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html'>the documentation</a>
    for the full list of data types for a schema.</li>
    </ul>
Once we've created the model, we perform operations on the database using
it.</p>    

<h3>Retrieving data from the database</h3>
<p>Here is an example to find all students in the <em>students</em>
collection using the <em>Student</em> model.
<pre>
Student.find(
            (err,result)=&gt; {
                if(err) {
                    console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
                } else {
                    console.log(result);
                }
            });
</pre>
How is this working? We call the <em>find()</em> method on the model
(note how this is similar to calling <em>find()</em> from the MongoDB
console). Note how the <em>find()</em> method takes 
a <em>callback</em> to run once the results have been returned.
</p>
<p>Note how this callback takes two parameters: <em>err</em>, an object
representing an error (if there was one) and <em>result</em>, an array of
all the MongoDB documents returned from <em>find()</em>. This callback
pattern, an error object as the first parameter and the results as the
second, is a common pattern in Node modules.</p>
<p>Here, we simply display the results in the console.</p> 
<h4>Retrieving certain records only</h4>
<p>By supplying a search query to <em>find()</em> as the first argument
(<em>before</em> the callback), in a similar way to
queries in the Mongo console, we can retrieve certain records only. For
example, to find all students on Software Engineering:
<pre>
Student.find({<em>course:'Software Engineering'</em>},
            (err,result)=&gt; {
                if(err) {
                    console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
                } else {
                    console.log(result);
                }
            });
</pre>
and to find all students with a last name of Jones on Software Engineering:
<pre>
Student.find({<em>course:'Software Engineering', lastname:'Jones'</em>},
            (err,result)=&gt; {
                if(err) {
                    console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
                } else {
                    console.log(result);
                }
            });
</pre>
</p>
<p>We can also use special Mongo operations such as <em>$lt</em>, 
<em>$gt</em>, <em>$in</em>,
<em>$or</em> etc. in our <em>find()</em> queries. For example, to find all
students who have passed:
<pre>
Student.find({grade: {$gte: 40}},
            (err,result)=&gt;{
                res.send(result);
            });
    });
</pre>
or, to find all students on Software Engineering or Computing:
<pre>
Student.find({course: { $in: ['Software Engineering', 'Computing']}},
            (err,result)=&gt;{
                res.send(result);
            });
});
</pre>
Mongoose also gives us some shortcuts for searching. For example, if we want
to find a particular document by <em>ID</em> (a common scenario), we can
just use the <em>findById()</em> method (the ID is the number associated with
an ObjectId):
<pre>
Student.findById("5c0cf71d4d49560f7c678f08",
            (err,result)=&gt;{
                res.send(result);
            });
    });
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Adding a new document</h3>
<p>To add a new document to a collection, we create an object of the model
type  and <em>save()</em> it. <em>save()</em>ing it saves it to the actual
MongoDB collection. For example, to create a new student and save it to the
collection:
<pre>const student = new Student ({ firstname:'Tom', 
                                lastname: 'Smith', 
                                course: 'Software Engineering',     
                                grade: 80});
student.save();</pre>
Note that <em>if the collection associated with the model ('students' here)
does not exist, saving the object to the database will create it.</em>
</p>
<p>Note that this will allocate a unique ObjectId for the document.
We can obtain it using <em>student._id</em>.</p>
<h3>Updating a document</h3>
<p>Updating a document can be carried out by the <em>update()</em> group of
methods of your model. There are different variants of update(), such as
<em>updateOne()</em> which will only update the first matching document 
and <em>updateMany()</em> which will update <em>all</em> matching documents.</p>
<p>These take three arguments, the search criteria, the update operation and
the callback. For example, this will update the grade of the first matching
student with a first name of <em>Tim</em> and last name of <em>Smith</em> to
70.
<pre>
Student.updateOne({firstname:'Tim', lastname:'Smith'}, {grade: 70},
           (err,result) =&gt;
            {
                if(!err)
                {
                    if(result.nModified==1)
                    {
                        console.log("updated");
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        console.log("not updated - does student exist?");
                    }
                }
                else
                {
                    console.log(err);
                }
            }
);
</pre>
Note how, for an update, the <em>result</em> object has an <em>nModified</em>
field, storing the number of records that were modified. We can use this
to test whether we successfully managed to update a document or not; if not,
it likely means that there is no student called <em>Tim Smith</em> in the
database.</p>
<p>Note that we do not need to use <em>$set</em> with Mongoose. If we only
want to update certain fields of the document, we can pass in those
fields only. So the above example will update the grade to 70 for Tim
Smith, but will not remove all the other fields of the document.</p>

</p>
<h3>Deleting records</h3>
<p>Deleting records is similar to updating them; we can use the
<em>deleteOne()</em> and <em>deleteMany()</em> methods of our model.
These methods take two arguments; the criteria for deletion, and the 
callback. For example, this will delete all students with a grade less than 30:
<pre>
Student.deleteMany({grade: {$lt: 30}},
    (err,result)=&gt;{
        if(err) {
            console.log(`Error deleting: ${err}`);
        } else if (result.n==0) {
            console.log('No matching students found!');
        } else {
            console.log(`Successfully deleted ${result.n} documents.`);
        }
});
</pre>
Note how, once again, we can test how many documents were successfully
deleted using the result object. With delete, we use the <em>n</em>
field rather than <em>nModified</em>.</p>

<h3>Structure of an Express server using Mongoose</h3>
<p>Connect to the database first, e.g:
<pre>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test');

mongoose.connection.once('open', ()=&gt; {
    // Create models ...

    // Handle routes ...
});
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>Develop a Node/Express REST HT-Tracks server which uses a MongoDB back end
(i.e. the <em>hits</em> collection you worked with last time). It should
support the following operations:
<ul>
<li><em>/search/:artist</em> - should search the database for all songs by
a given artist and return the results as JSON.</li>
<li><em>/search/:song/:artist</em> - should search the database for a 
specific song by a specific artist and return the results as JSON.</li>
<li><em>/newSong</em> - should read the details of a new song as POST 
data and add a new document to the database. To test this you will need
to create an HTML form.</li>
<li><em>/before/:year</em> - should search for all songs before a given
year and return them as JSON.</li>
<li><em>/song/:id</em> - should do the following depending on HTTP method:
    <ul>
    <li>GET - return JSON of the song with that ID;</li>
    <li>PUT - read in JSON containing selected properites of the song and their
    values, e.g:
    <pre>{"downloads": 123}</pre>
    and update the song with that ID to those quantities;</li>
    <li>DELETE - delete the song with that ID.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
To test these APIs: you can test those which take GET and POST in the 
browser directly, or via a form, respectively.
 For those which use PUT and DELETE, use
<a href='https://getpostman.com'>Postman</a> (which appears to be installable
locally). I will demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Finally, connect your AJAX front end from week 7 to your 'search'
functionality.</p>
