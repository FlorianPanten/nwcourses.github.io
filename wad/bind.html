<h1>Topic 17: Use of "bind"</h1>
<p>This topic is only intended for students who are up-to-date. You must 
complete Topics 1-4, 6-8, and 11-12 before you attempt this.
Also, you need to have completed the "Classes" section of Topic 9 to understand the examples.</p>
<h2>"this" and callbacks</h2>
<h3>Subtleties with "this"</h3>
<p>There are a number of subtleties with JavaScript <em>this</em> which you need to understand to work
effectively with objects, and which make its use
less straightforward than the use of <em>this</em> in other languages such as Java and C++. <strong>These subtleties are particularly important when it
comes to callbacks.</strong></p>
<h3>"this" and the window object</h3>
<p>Firstly, what does <em>this</em> refer to if it is not being used in the context of an object?
For example, if the function below was run, what would be displayed?
<pre>
function thisTest()
{
    alert(this);
}
</pre>
On Firefox it displays:
<pre>[object Window]</pre>
The output demonstrates what <em>this</em> refers to when out of the context of an object. It refers to a <em>"default object"</em> which in a web browser is the <em>window</em> object, representing
the browser window as a whole. So the example below would work too:
<pre>
function thisTest()
{
    window.alert("alert is actually a method of the window object!");
    this.alert("... and here, *this* refers to the window so this works too!");
}
</pre>
Both alerts are displayed. <em>alert()</em> is actually a method of the window object, but because
the window object is the environment's "default" object, we can normally leave <em>window</em> out;
it's included here just to illustrate the point. And
because <em>this</em> also refers to the window object in this context, the second alert will be
displayed too.</p>
<h3>"this" and callbacks - the problem</h3>
<p>The problem most commonly encountered with "this" is 
when it is being used in a <em>callback function</em>. As we have
seen, a <em>callback function</em> is a function that does not run immediately,
but at a later time, when some event has occurred (such as the user clicking a button,
or the response from an AJAX request is received). So imagine we had a Cat and we wanted it to meow if
we pressed a button, e.g:
<pre>
// cat.js
class Cat 
{

    constructor(n,a)
    {
        this.theName=n;
        this.age=a;
    }

    meow()
    {
        alert(`${this.theName} says meow!`);
    }
}



// Create the cat
const tom = new Cat("Tom", 7);

// When the user clicks the button, the meow method will run
document.getElementById("meowbtn").addEventListener("click", tom.meow);

</pre>
HTML:
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='cat.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;input type='button' id='meowbtn' value='Meow!' /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>If you try this out, and click the button, does the expected output:
<pre>Tom says Meow!</pre>
occur? No. Instead, you will get something like:
<pre>undefined says Meow!</pre>
Why is this happening? 
<ul>
<li>On a simple level, it is because <em>callback functions do not keep track of the object that
the method relates to.</em> So when we click the button, the meow function will be called but
the fact that it relates to the object <em>tom</em> is not retained. So when we try to display
<em>theName</em> of the current object, we get <em>undefined</em> because the current object
is not <em>tom</em> and hence has no <em>theName</em> property</li>
<li>To explain in more depth: <em>when we are using a callback function, the context of
the function changes</em>. In this example, we are basically setting the <em>click</em>
event handler of the button to be the meow method of the object <em>tom</em>. But the object
<em>tom</em> itself is <em>not</em> copied across. Instead, the code in <em>meow()</em> is copied
across to the button object, and becomes the <em>click</em> method of the button object. So,
when we click the button, <em>this</em> is actually the button object! Buttons do not have a
<em>theName</em> property, so we get <em>undefined</em>.</li>
<li>Note that <em>arrow functions always preserve the context of this</em>
so we don't have the same sort of problem if we use an arrow function as a 
callback. However, frequently we want to make a method of a class or object a callback function, as 
we have done here. In these cases, we are forced to deal with the
the "context of this" problem and ensure that <em>this</em> refers to
the correct object in the callback.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Dealing with "this" issues in callbacks with bind()</h2>
<p>Luckily, the issue is easy to deal with.
You can simply use the <em>bind()</em> method.
<em>bind()</em> does what it says on the tin: it binds the callback function to the specified
object, so that when the callback is called, <em>this</em> will refer to the correct object.
So to rewrite our Cat example so they work correctly:
<pre>
class Cat 
{

    constructor(n,a)
    {
        this.theName=n;
        this.age=a;
    }

    meow()
    {
        alert(`${this.theName} says meow!`);
    }
}


// Runs when the page loads

// Create the cat
const tom = new Cat("Tom", 7);

// When the user clicks the button, the meow method will run
    document.getElementById("meowbtn").addEventListener("click", <em>tom.meow.bind(tom)</em>);

</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how the callback <em>tom.meow()</em> is now <em>bound</em> to the
object <em>tom</em>. This means that <em>this</em> will refer to the correct
object, <em>tom</em>, when <em>tom.meow()</em> is called as a callback on
response to a button click, or indeed any other event.</p>

<h3>bind() and arguments</h3>
<p>You can specify arguments to be sent to a bound function. 
For example, imagine we wanted to make the cat walk a certain distance
when the user clicks a button. We need to make the <em>walk()</em> method 
a callback (and therefore, use <em>bind()</em>) but we also need to
pass in the distance to walk. How can we do this?
<pre>
class Cat 
{

    constructor(n,a,w)
    {
        this.theName=n;
        this.age=a;
        this.weight=w;
    }

    meow()
    {
        alert(`${this.theName} says meow!`);
    }

    walk(d) 
    {
        this.weight -= d;
    }    
}


// Create the cat
const tom = new Cat("Tom", 7, 50);

// When the user clicks the button, the walk() method will run
// and will take an argument of 5
document.getElementById("walkbtn").addEventListener("click", <em>tom.walk.bind(tom, 5)</em>);

</pre>
Note here that when we call the <em>walk()</em> function as a callback whenever
the user clicks the 'walk' button, <em>walk() automatically receives an argument
of 5</em>; the parameter <em>d</em> will be set equal to 5, so the cat will
walk 5 units of distance. The rule is that <em>arguments to bind() following the
context of "this" will become parameters to the specified callback function</em>.

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p><strong>Write these using CommonJS modules. Use one module per class and write an
index.js file to act as the entry point for your application, which requires the module(s)
you need.</strong>
See <a href='modules.html'>here</a>.</p>
<p>Revisit your car scenario from Topics 8 and 9. Ensure you write your Car as a class.
Add additional methods to start and stop the engine (similar to the example
above) and ensure that <em>accelerate()</em> will only run if the engine is
running, otherwise display an error. Add buttons on your page to start and stop
the engine and accelerate and decelerate the car, and to display the current
car details. Connect these buttons to the appropriate methods of Car, ensuring
that you use <em>bind()</em> to preserve the context of <em>this</em>.</p>
<li><strong>This will require you to read up on key events, which is in the
further notes for Topic 10</strong> (see <a href='furtherevents.html'>here</a>).
Create a class representing a Hero in a game. It should have x and y coordinates,
and also an Image object, as properties. Give it a <em>display()</em> method.
The display() method should take a canvas <em>context</em> as a parameter and,
using the canvas context,
should draw the Hero at its current x and y coordinates. Also give the Hero
methods to move left, right, up and down, which should change x and y
appropriately. Connect this to a web page with a 
canvas, and using key events, move and display the hero in response to the arrow keys by calling the 
appopriate methods of the Hero.</p>
