</div>

<p>In the last few sessions we have looked at node.js and seen that we can
use <em>modules</em> to develop reusable code, for example a database 
connection, or a set of routes. You have also imported third-party modules,
such as Express or Mongoose. These modules are referred to as
<strong>CommonJS modules</strong>.</p>

<p>However it is also possible, with the help of a few tools, to use
modules when developing client-side, browser-based JavaScript. For example,
you might have developed a few JavaScript classes which could be reused in
different web applications. You could create a module from each class by 
writing the class in its own .js file and exporting it. For example, we could
create this file, <em>cat.js</em>:
<pre>
class Cat {
    constructor(n, a, w) {
        this.name = n;
        this.age = a;
        this.weight = w;
    }

    eat() {
        this.weight++;
    }

    walk() {
        this.weight--;
    }

    toString() {
        return `${this.name} ${this.age} ${this.weight}`;
    }
}

<em>module.exports = Cat;</em>
</pre>
Note how we are exporting the Cat class from the module, just like we did
in our Node modules. We could then use this module in other JavaScript 
code, e.g, we could create this "main" JavaScript file, <em>index.js</em>:
<pre>
const Cat = require('./cat'); // the Cat class is exported from the module
const cat = new Cat("Tiddles", 10, 10);
cat.walk();
cat.walk();
cat.eat();
console.log(cat);
</pre>
Note how we <em>require</em> the module just as in node.js. Also note the
single dot (.); this means the module is in the current folder. Also note
that we can leave out the <em>.js</em> extension when importing a module.
</p>
<p>How would we run our "main" JavaScript (index.js)? Note there is
no <em>init()</em> function or equivalent. We can run arbitrary 
JavaScript code (without a startup function) by adding a <em>defer</em>
option to our &lt;script&gt; tag. This will prevent the script running
until the page has been fully loaded. For example:
<pre>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='index.js' <em>defer</em> /&gt;</pre>
This will cause the code in index.js to (in theory) run when the page has
been loaded.</p>
<p>However, this code, as it stands, will not actually run successfully in
the browser. The browser will not be able to make sense of the
<em>require()</em> call. There is a new module mechanism, <em>ECMAScript 6
modules</em>, which will allow browsers to run modules directly, but at the 
moment, these are not fully supported in browsers or in node.js, and part of
the rationale for using modules in code intended for the browser is to allow 
it to be reused with Node applications.</p>

<h2>Browserify</h2>

<p>There are a number of tools - "bundlers" - 
which can be used to prepare CommonJS modules
for the browser. One of these tools is <strong>Browserify</strong>
(see <a href='http://browserify.org'>browserify.org</a>). Browserify can
transform code consisting of modules into a single "bundle" file which can
be used directly in the browser. Browserify can be installed with npm,
e.g. globally:
<pre>sudo npm install -g browserify</pre>
Here is the most simple usage:
<pre>browserify index.js &gt; bundle.js</pre>
This will take the file index.js, and any modules it uses (along with any
modules used by those modules) and prepare a single bundle file, bundle.js.
This can then be used directly in the browser with the <em>defer</em>
attribute to ensure it's only loaded when the page is loaded, e.g:
<pre>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='bundle.js' <em>defer</em> /&gt;</pre>
One key advantage of using a bundler like Browserify is it allows you to
use various modules provided by <em>npm</em> in browser code. These would
typically be <em>require</em>d, so by bundling code which uses npm modules,
you can make it run in the browser - as long as the npm modules you use are
not Node-specific.</p>

<h2>Babel and uglify-js</h2>

<p>This is also a good point to mention two other common tools, 
<em>Babel</em> and <em>uglify-js</em>. What do these do? First, <em>Babel</em>
(see <a href='https://babeljs.io/'>here</a>). Babel is known as a <em>transpiler</em>. It converts between different
versions of JavaScript. It is commonly used to transform ECMAScript 6 code
(classes, arrow functions, etc) into "classic" JavaScript so that the code
can run on older browsers. Babel requires <em>presets</em> to run, to
tell it what transformations to make. The <em>env</em> preset is a common
one, this tells Babel to transform ECMAScript6+ code into ECMAScript 5.
For example:
<pre>babel --presets @babel/preset-env cat.js &gt; cat-ecma5.js</pre>
</p>
<p>Babel can be installed with:
<pre>sudo npm install -g @babel/core @babel/cli</pre>
(babel-cli is the babel command-line tool)</p>

<h2>Browserify transforms</h2>

<p>However, what if we wanted to use Browserify and Babel in one go, to 
create an ECMAScript 5 bundle compatible with old browsers? We
can do that by using a Browserify <em>transform</em> - a plugin which adds
third-party functionality to Browserify. Such a transform exists for
Babel: <em>babelify</em> (see <a href='https://github.com/babel/babelify'>here</a>). 
This can be installed with npm in the normal way,
as long as Babel is already installed:
<pre>sudo npm install -g babelify</pre>
You can then use Browserify with the <em>-t</em> (transform) option, e.g.:
<pre>browserify index.js -t [ babelify --presets [ @babel/preset-env ] ] &gt; bundle-ecma5.js</pre>

<h3>uglify-js</h3>

<p>Another useful tool is <em>uglify-js</em> (see
<a href='https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS'>here</a>) This is an example of a
<em>minifier</em> - a tool which removes the whitespace from a bundle 
to reduce its filesize and speed up loading time. Its usage is quite easy:
<pre>uglifyjs bundle.js &gt; bundle-uglified.js</pre>
It can be installed with:
<pre>npm install -g uglify-js</pre>
However, if using with browserify, we can again perform both operations
(bundle creation and minification) in one go, using another transform.
The transform for uglify-js is called <em>uglifyify</em>(!) and is actually
based not on uglify-js itself, but a fork, <a href='https://github.com/terser/terser'>Terser</a>, 
which has been adapted to
handle ECMAScript 6 syntax (plain uglify-js itself cannot do this). This can
be used with the -t option of browserify as before:
<pre>browserify index.js -t uglifyify &gt; bundle-minified.js</pre>
and can be installed with:
<pre>sudo npm install -g uglifyify</pre>
</p>
