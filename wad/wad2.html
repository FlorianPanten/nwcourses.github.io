<h1>The Slim Framework and REST</h1>

<p>In this unit we are going to focus on the <em>Slim Framework</em> to develop REST
applications. Last year, in DFTI, you were introduced to Slim but it might be new to you
if you come from another university.</p>

<h2>Representational State Transfer - REST</h2>

<p> Representational State Transfer, REST, is not a technology, but
<em>an architecture for web services</em>. The idea centres around using clear, highly-descriptive
URLs to represent each <em>real-world entity</em> that our web application needs to deal with 
(e.g. a song, a list of all songs by a given artist, a flight, a 
biography of an actor, etc). For example we could have these URLs:
<pre>
http://www.hittastic.com/artist/Oasis
http://www.hittastic.com/biography/Madonna
http://www.solentairways.com/flight/SA101
http://www.solentairways.com/flights/June/1/Southampton/New_York
</pre>
</p>
<p>In REST, these URLs are called <em>resources</em>.
REST has the following key principles:
	<ul>
	<li>Use of clear, unchanging and descriptive
	URLs to represent real-world items or entities(as in the example above);</li>
      <li>The URL should produce the data expected of it, e.g 
	<em>http://www.solentairways.com/flight/SA101</em> should return data representing
	Solent Airways flight SA101</li>
	<li>The ability to send different instructions to the URL to make it behave in different
	ways, i.e. we can send a URL one type of instruction to retrieve data and another type
	to modify data associated with that URL.</li>
	<li>Statelessness</li> 
	</ul>
</p>
<h3>Clean and unchanging URLs</h3>
<p>A key principle of REST, illustrated by the examples above,
is that of <em>clean, unchanging URLs</em>. Why is this useful?
URLs which show the real location on the server, or the server-side
technology used (e.g. the fact that it's a PHP 
script) are prone to continuous change, for example, if the script is moved
to a different directory or we switch server-side scripting technology.
This causes problems in bookmarking and linking to such pages, and also,
if the URLs represent web services, means that developers of client 
applications have to update their client code to point to the new URL.</p>
<p>With REST, we hide the implementation details with a simple, clean and
easily-remembered URL, and define how this URL is <em>mapped</em> to the
real, underlying location of the script on the server. 
For example, rather than
<pre>http://www.hittastic.com/track.php?title=Wonderwall&amp;artist=Oasis</pre>
we could use:
<pre>http://www.hittastic.com/Oasis/Wonderwall</pre>
The web server software would convert this REST-style URL to the real, underlying script.</p>
<p>If we changed the underlying URL, i.e. the location of the actual server
side script on the server, all we'd need to do is change the mapping
of our clean, easily remembered, publicly-visible, "REST-style" URL to the real underlying URL, 
and clients of the web service could continue to use our web service unchanged with the same 
publicly-visible URL as before; they wouldn't have to alter their
code to reflect the new underlying URL. We could even change the 
server-side implementation technology (e.g. PHP to ASP) without having
to change the publicly-visible URL: once again we would only have to change
the mapping from the publicly-visible URL to the underlying URL.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this allows us to easily 
 <em>swap between dynamically and statically generated data</em>. Imagine the 
 URL
below points at a static (i.e. not dynamically generated) JSON file on the server representing all Oasis hits.
<pre>
http://www.hittastic.com/artist/Oasis
</pre>
By changing the server configuration, we could easily change this URL to point to a server side script which
dynamically generates the data from a database. So in summary, <em>REST style URLs provide a clean and
unchanging interface to data supplied by our server</em> and there is <em>no need to change the URL depending
on how the data associated with that URL is generated</em>.
</p>
<p>The practical details of how to actually set up REST-style URLs to point to given
scripts will be discussed towards the end of this week's notes.</p>
<h3>REST and HTTP</h3>
<p>With REST, we send <em>different types of messages</em> to <em>the same URL</em> to make it
do different things, e.g. retrieve data or change the state of the item represented by the URL. 
For example if we had the URL:
<pre>
http://www.solentairways.com/flight/SA101
</pre>
we could send one type of message (let's call it a "get" message)
to to the URL to retrieve the details about flight SA101, and another type
of message (let's call it a "put" message)
to update the details (e.g. departure time) of flight SA101, 
and a third type (let's call it a "delete" message) to delete flight SA101.</p>
<p>But what form do these messages take? We could use query string
parameters to inform the script of the message type. However, like custom
error codes, this could be seen as reinventing the wheel.
Last week we looked at <em>HTTP methods</em> and encountered the recommendation
to send GET requests when retrieving data or POST requests when adding or modifying
data. REST combines this concept in conjunction with the "one URL per real world entity"
concept already introduced. So you could send a GET request to the <em>SA101</em> URL above
to retrieve data about flight SA101, or a POST request to modify data about SA101.</p>
<p>However, in addition to GET and POST,
REST uses a couple of <em>additional</em> and less-commonly-encountered
HTTP methods: <em>PUT</em> and <em>DELETE</em>. In REST,
<em>PUT</em> differs from <em>POST</em> in that PUT is used to <em>modify</em> data while
POST is used to <em>add</em> new data. DELETE requests, unsurprisingly, are used to delete
data.</p>
<p>REST takes the view that HTTP methods and status codes are under-used
and can be exploited in web services, as described below.</p>
<h4>REST and HTTP methods</h4>
<p>
As mentioned above, the idea is that one single web resource (URL) can be used for retrieving, 
adding, and deleting data associated with a particular item, e.g. a 
particular song in the HitTastic! database. What we can do is to do different
things with the song depending on the type of HTTP method we use to 
communicate with the URL. In general we:
	<ul>
	<li>Use the GET method to retrieve data associated with a URL;</li>
	<li>Use the PUT method to modify data associated with a URL;</li>
	<li>Use the DELETE method to delete data associated with a URL;</li>
	<li>Use the POST method to create a brand new server resource e.g. a new song.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h4>REST and HTTP status codes</h4>
<p>As well as using HTTP methods, REST applications use <em>HTTP status codes</em> to indicate
errors to clients.
Recall that the first line of any HTTP 
response is a <em>status code</em> which indicates whether the request was successful or not.
There are a large number of HTTP status codes including:
    <ul>
    <li><em>200 OK</em> - the page was retrieved successfully</li>
    <li><em>400 Bad Request</em> - the request is in an invalid format</li>
    <li><em>401 Unauthorized</em> - we try to access a page which we don't
    have rights to view</li> 
    <li><em>404 Not Found</em> - the page could not be found</li>

    <li><em>500 Internal Server Error</em> - there was some sort of
    internal error on the server</li>
    </ul>
REST Web services make use of these to communicate the success or otherwise of the operation. For example,
a <em>200 OK</em> might be returned if the operation was successful, or a <em>404 Not Found</em>
might be returned if we asked for a resource that did not exist.</p>
<h4>Difference in usage of HTTP codes in REST versus normal usage</h4>
<p>Imagine we had a REST web service to look up a given song: 
<pre>http://hittastic.com/song/id/1009</pre>
This script could return "404 Not Found" 
to the client if the song with that ID was not on the HitTastic! database,
or, if an invalid ID (0 or less) was supplied, the script could return
"400 Bad Request", another standard HTTP error code.
Note that this use of error codes <em>differs from the normal usage</em>:
    <ul>
    <li>Normally, "404 Not Found" is used to indicate that a given file on the server 
    does not exist. This error is generated by the web server software (e.g. Apache).</li>
    <li>Here, the web service <em>does</em> exist. It runs, looking up the song
    with the ID 1009. If no song with that ID exists, a "404 Not Found" 
    is generated <em>by the script</em> to inform the client of the error.</li>
    <li>So, the error codes are being re-used by the web service to indicate an error
    generated by the <em>script</em> rather than the <em>web server software</em>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>The Slim Framework</h2>

<p>We looked at the Slim framework last year briefly in DFTI, but here we will look at it
in the context of REST web services. However as not everyone was here last year, I will
introduce Slim from scratch. Slim is a relatively easy approach to create REST web services
in PHP.</p>

<h3>Architecture of a Slim application</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Slim application typically contains a single <em>index.php</em> containing handlers for
<em>routes</em></li>
<li>A route is a combination of a URL pattern matching a REST-style URL, and a function
to handle that URL pattern. For example, considering the REST-style URLs above:
<pre>
http://www.hittastic.com/allSongs
http://www.hittastic.com/allArtists
</pre>
the corresponding URL patterns in a Slim application, running on <em>hittastic.com</em>, would be:
<pre>
/allSongs
/allArtists
</pre>
and the <em>routes</em> for these URL patterns would be a combination of the pattern and
the code to handle the pattern - you will see this below.
</li>
<li><em>Both routes</em> here would be handled by <em>a single index.php</em>
with Slim; you would <em>not</em> have a separate PHP script for each.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Introducing .htaccess</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>.htaccess</em> is an Apache configuration file which allows URLs
to be <em>rewritten</em></li>
<li>It is used by the Apache module (extension) <em>mod_rewrite</em></li>
<li>It is often used to allow REST-style "clean", easy-to-remember
URLs to be used, rather than URLs including query string details</li>
<li>For example a .htaccess file could be used to rewrite the "clean" URL
<pre>hittastic.com/song/123</pre>
to the "real" underlying URL:
<pre>hittastic.com/song.php?id=123</pre>
</li>
<li>Slim uses .htaccess to allow routes (such as those above) to be rewritten
so that they are all rewritten to index.php, and index.php then handles each
route</li>
</ul>
<h3>.htaccess with Slim</h3>
<p>Here is an example of a .htaccess file to be used with Slim:
<pre>
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
</pre>
What does this mean?
<ul>
<li>The first line turns the URL rewriting engine on</li>
<li>The second and third check that the requested URL is not an existing
file (-f) or directory (-d)</li>
<li>The fourth and final line rewrites all other URLs to <em>index.php</em>.
The [QSA] instruction "query string append" specifies that any existing query string
parameters in the REST-style URL 
will be added to the rewritten URL. The [L] specifies that no further rewrite
instructions (e.g. those in the Apache configuration file) will be processed after this one.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Installing Slim - Introduction to Composer</h3>
<p>Slim is a third-party library; it is not part of the core PHP 
distribution. However it is quite easy to install thanks to 
<em>Composer</em>. Composer (see <a href="https://getcomposer.org">here</a>) 
is a dependency 
management system for PHP projects, allowing you to import specified third-party libraries (<em>dependencies</em> - so called because your project depends on
them). You create a <em>composer.json</em> file specifying which
libraries are needed, and then run an install command, and all necessary
dependencies will be installed. Composer itself can be downloaded as
an application from the Composer site: the Composer application is
a file named <em>composer.phar</em> which is typically saved to your home
directory (~ on Linux systems) and run with PHP, e.g:
<pre>php ~/composer.phar (Composer command)</pre>
</p>
<p>However on Neptune, Composer is installed globally so you can just use <em>composer</em> to run it.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a composer.json file for Slim:
<pre>
{
    "require": {
        "slim/slim" : "^3.0"
    }
}
</pre>
This means, as you might expect, the Slim package is a dependency of
your project, and it needs to be at least version 3.0. (Version 4 was released over
the summer, but is more complex for beginners to use, so we will stick with version 3. However,
feel free to research and implement v.4 for your assignment!) You can add
multiple libraries to the "require" block. Once you have setup a 
composer.json, you can then install the dependencies with:
<pre>composer install</pre>
See
<a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/">here</a> for full documentation on
Composer.</p>
<p>However you do not have to write the composer.json file yourself. You 
can <em>require</em> a package by running Composer's require command,
e.g. by running this in your project directory:
<pre>composer require slim/slim</pre>
This will generate a composer.json automatically, and will also load all
the dependencies.</p>
<p>The dependencies will be downloaded to a <em>vendor</em> directory within
your project directory. Also, an <em>autoload.php</em> will be generated in
this project directory, allowing you to automatically include all the
necessary PHP files for all dependencies. 
So in your PHP code, you can simply add:
<pre>
&lt;?php
require("vendor/autoload.php");
...
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Slim Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>See the <a href="https://www.slimframework.com">Slim website</a>
</li>
<li><strong>In particular, see the
<a href="https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/tutorial/first-app.html">
First Application Walkthrough</a> tutorial.</strong> This explains the concepts
covered here, but in more detail.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hello World with Slim</h3>
<p>The example below is the Hello World of Slim. Note that it's 
annotated with comments.</p>
<pre>

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' directory which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object. (v3 method)
$app = new \Slim\App;

// Setup a route (see below)
$app-&gt;get('/hello', function ($req, $res, array $args) {
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write('Hello World from Slim!');
    return $res;
});

// Run the application
$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
<p>Note how we we handle a <em>routes</em>. A route is, as we saw above, a combination
of a URL pattern and a function to handle requests matching that URL pattern.
Slim allows us to set up routes very easily, for both 'GET' and 'POST' methods.
Here we are creating a route called <em>/hello</em>.
For example for HitTastic!,
it might be:
<pre>http://hittastic.com/hello</pre>
</p>
<p>The handler for the route is a function which takes three parameters,
<em>$req</em> representing the HTTP request, <em>$res</em> representing the
HTTP response, and <em>$args</em> for any arguments sent to the application
(see below). In this example we call the <em>send()</em> method of the
response object to send back <em>Hello World from Slim!</em> to the 
client.</p>
<h2>Example with multiple routes</h2>
<pre>

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' directory which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object. (v3 method)
$app = new \Slim\App;



$app-&gt;get('/hello', function($req, $res, array $args) {
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write('Hello World!');
    return $res;
});


$app-&gt;get('/time', function($req, $res, array $args) {
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write("There have been ". time() ." milliseconds since 1/1/70.");
    return $res;
});
$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
<p>This example sets up two routes matching URL patterns '/hello' and '/time'. The first will
send back 'Hello World!' and the second will send back the number of 
milliseconds since January 1st 1970. You could set up <em>POST</em>
routes
with <em>$app-&gt;post()</em>; we will see an example of this later.</p>
<h3>URL placeholders</h3>
<p>Slim allows us to easily specify placeholders for variable URLs,  e.g we could
define a route such as:
<pre>
/artist/{artistname}
</pre>
Here, <em>artistname</em> is a placeholder which can be replaced by any artist, so that
the following would match on the <em>hittastic.com</em> server:
<pre>
http://hittastic.com/artist/Oasis
http://hittastic.com/artist/Madonna
</pre>
Both of these would be handled by the <em>artist</em> route, with the {artistname}
placeholder representing the specified artist. We can then use the <em>$args</em> array
passed into the handler to retrieve the actual value of the placeholder.</p>
<p>Here is a full example which displays a student ID passed into the URL:
<pre>;

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' directory which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object. (v3 method)
$app = new \Slim\App;



$app-&gt;get('/student/<em>{id}</em>', function($req, $res, array $args) {
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write("You selected the student with ID ". $args["id"]. "&lt;br /&gt;");
    return $res;
});


$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
Note how this will setup the route matching the URL <em>/student</em> followed
by a placeholder <em>{id}</em> representing the student ID. So URLs such as
<pre>
http://server/student/1144332
http://server/student/1239723
http://server/student/goat
</pre>
will be matched. (There is no check that ntimes is numeric, so the final
URL will be matched. However you can use regular expressions in Slim
routes to ensure that only numbers are passed in the placeholder; see
<a href="https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/objects/router.html">here</a>).
</p>
<p>
To access the named placeholder from the PHP code, we use the <em>$args</em> parameter
to our handler function, so, in this example, we would use <em>$args['id']</em> to 
access the specified ID.</p>
<p>Note we can specify more than one parameter with multiple placeholders in the
URL.</p>

<h3>Setting up database connections - using a dependency injection container</h3>

<p>The examples so far have simply displayed data, to illustrate route handling. However a
real app would obviously need to actually <em>perform database queries</em>. How do we do
this? For maximum flexibility, Slim does not have its own database connection functionality -
instead, you as the developer can use whichever database connection library (such as PDO)
you like.</p>

<p>Slim introduces the concept of a <em>dependency injection container</em>. Dependency
injection is a software development pattern which is designed to avoid dependencies of
one library on another by placing ("injecting") these dependencies in a 
<em>container object</em>
which is independent of the objects making up our chosen framework (such as Slim).</p>

<p>In this way, Slim is not dependent on a particular database library, for example, but
can work with whichever database library has been placed in this container object.
So, if we are using PDO, we can place our PDO connection inside the container and refer to
it in our route handlers. The example below shows this:
<pre>

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' directory which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object. (v3 method)
$app = new \Slim\App;

$container = $app-&gt;getContainer();

$container['db'] = function() {

    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=dftitutorials", "dftitutorials", "dftitutorials");
    return $conn;
};


$app-&gt;get('/student/{id}', function ($req, $res, array $args) {
    $stmt = $this-&gt;db-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM students WHERE studentid=?");
    $stmt-&gt;bindParam (1, $args['id']);
    $stmt-&gt;execute();
    $row = $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write("Student name ". $row['name']. " Course: " . $row['course']);
    return $res;
});

$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
Note in the example how we obtain the Slim app's container with:
<pre>$container = $app-&gt;getContainer();</pre>
and then add a <em>db</em> field to the container, which is set equal to a function which
<em>returns</em> the PDO database connection.</p>
<p>Note also how we refer to the database connection in the <em>/student/{id}</em> route
handler.We're using <em>$this-&gt;db</em> to refer to the PDO database connection; note how
this corresponds to the <em>db</em> field of the container object.</p>



<h3>Generating JSON using Slim</h3>
<p>
The examples so far have covered very basic use of Slim to generate HTML. However, we are interested
in <strong>web service development</strong>, so we are more interested in outputting <em>JSON</em> from our
Slim app. The good news is that it's very easy to generate JSON
from a Slim web service once you know the basics of Slim above: you simply call the
<strong>withJson()</strong> method on your Response object and return its result from your
route handler. This will generate the response as JSON. For example:
<pre>

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' directory which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object. (v3 method)
$app = new \Slim\App;

// Setup the dependency injection container - as in the last example
$container = $app-&gt;getContainer();

$container['db'] = function() {

    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=dftitutorials", "dftitutorials", "dftitutorials")
    return $conn;
};

$app-&gt;get('/primeMinisters/{country}', function($req, $res, array $args) {
	$stmt = $this-&gt;db-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM primeMinisters WHERE country=?")
	$stmt-&gt;bindParam (1, $args["country"]);
	$stmt-&gt;execute();
	$results = $stmt-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); // or fetch() to fetch one row
	return $res-&gt;withJson($results);
});
</pre>
</p>

<h3>HTTP status codes</h3>

<p>As we saw above, in the REST discussion, HTTP status codes are used to communicate errors to clients
when writing web services. How can we generate HTTP error codes? Again this is easy, the
<em>withStatus()</em> method is used. For example, this would generate a 400 Bad Request:
<pre>return $res-&gt;withStatus(400);</pre>
</p>
 
<h2>The "correct" way to write Slim code</h2>
<p>The examples above were deliberately simplified to make things easier for beginners. Here is a version of
the "Hello World" example done the "correct" way. It introduces the PHP features of <em>namespaces</em> and 
<em>type declarations</em>. Note the comments which explain each feature.
<pre>

// Import classes from the Psr library (standardised HTTP requests and responses)
// This illustrates the PHP feature of <em>NAMESPACES</em>. When developing PHP code there is the possibility that
// two libraries contain classes of the same name, e.g. two Request classes. To prevent clashes, we 
// declare a namespace for each library and put the class inside the namespace. To use the class from 
// outside the library, we need to import it with the "use" statement.
// Here, we are importing the classes "ServerRequestInterface" and "ResponseInterface" from
// the namespace <em>Psr\Http\Message</em>, and then <em>aliasing</em> them as <em>Request</em> and
// <em>Response</em> respectively.

use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' directory which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object. (v3 method)
$app = new \Slim\App;

// Setup a route.
// Note the <em>type declarations</em> here. The parameters $req and $res are
// declared as data type <em>Request</em> and <em>Response</em> respectively,
// which will enforce that these parameters are of these types, similar to 
// other more strongly-typed languages such as Java.

$app-&gt;get('/hello', function (Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write('Hello World from Slim!');
    return $res;
});

// Run the application
$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<h3>Standard exercises</h3>
<p>You are going to develop a REST web service using Slim called <em>HT-Tracks</em>, which will
query the HitTastic! database and return JSON of songs to clients.</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to Neptune via PuTTY, change directory to <em>public_html</em>, make a 
separate <em>wad</em> directory for your work and change directory to it:
<pre>cd public_html
mkdir wad
cd wad</pre>
Use Composer to install Slim and its dependencies:
<pre>php ~vmadmin/composer.phar require slim/slim:^3.0</pre>
The <em>^3.0</em> ensures that Slim v3 is installed.</li>
<li>Write (using Notepad++ in the normal way)
a HitTastic! web service (index.php) using Slim. It should have the following routes:
	<ul>
	<li>an <em>allSongs</em> route to show ALL songs in the database;</li>
	<li>an <em>artist</em> route, containing an artist parameter, to find all songs by a given
	artist;</li>
	<li>a <em>/song/{song}/artist/{artist}</em> route, to find a given song by a given artist.
	</ul>
In all cases, return the result as JSON. <strong>Note that the table on Neptune is wadsongs.</strong>
Note that the database login should be:
<pre>
database wad
username wad
password wad
</pre>
</li>
<li>Also write your <em>.htaccess</em> file, as shown above.</li>
<li>Transfer both files to your <em>wad</em> directory using FileZilla in the normal way and test.</li>
</ol>
<h3>More advanced exercises</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add error handling to your <em>artist</em> and <em>/song/{song}/artist/{artist}</em> routes,
so that if there are no results, a 404 is returned. To test this, you can use the Network tab of
the developer tools in your browser. To check for no results, you can use
PHP's <em>count()</em> function to count the number of entries in the array,
e.g:
<pre>$rows = $stmt-&gt;fetchAll();
if(count($rows)==0) {
    ...
}</pre></li>
</ol>
<h3>Transfer to Edward2</h3>
<ol>
<li>Once it's working, transfer your work to Edward2. Slim has been setup
already here. To change, make the following changes:
<ul>
<li>Make a <em>wad</em> directory on Edward2 and transfer the index.php and .htaccess to this
directory.</li>
<li>Change the database name, username and password to <em>dftitutorials</em>;</li>
<li>Slim has already been installed globally on Edward2, so you won't need to use Composer.
(As Edward2 is the assignment server, console access is not available, unlike Neptune). Include Slim and
its dependencies with:
<pre>require '/var/www/html/share/vendor/autoload.php';</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation for next session - Fansite</h2>

<p>If you followed my instructions, you have hopefully done this already. </p>
<p>However, if not... do the
following. Create a one-page "fan" website for your favourite artist. The site must
have some CSS (enough to make it distinctive; it must, as a minimum, the CSS must set the
background and text colour and font) and should include a short biography
of the artist (get this from Wikipedia if necessary; if short of time, just state their date and town of birth).
<strong>Next session, you will connect this site to your
web service, retrieving all songs by that artist from the web service and
displaying them on the site.</strong></p>
<p>You need to make sure you use an artist in the database.
See <a href="https://edward2.solent.ac.uk/wad/hits.php">here</a> for a list of all the
songs and artists present.</p>
