<h1>Topic 4: POST-based web services and clients</h1>

<p>In this session, you will write a web service which
<em>updates the database</em> by adding new data, namely a review for a given song. 
</p>


<h2>POST data using Slim</h2>
<p>So far we have only looked at GET requests, however to create new data we need to use POST.
How do we handle POST data in Slim? Firstly, we set up a 'post' rather than
a 'get' route, and then we use the request's <em>getParsedBody()</em> method
to extract the POST data. For example, this sets up a POST route <em>/student/create</em>:
<pre>

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' folder which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object.
$app = new \Slim\App;

$app-&gt;post('/student/create', function ($req, $res, array $args) {
    $post = $req-&gt;getParsedBody();
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write("Student details : Name: ". $post['name']. " Username: ". $post['username']. " Course: " . $post['course']);
    return $res;
});


$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
</p>
<p>In this example, we could set up a form with an action of "/student/create" and fields with names
of <em>name</em>, <em>username</em> and <em>course</em>, and the Slim application would read, and display,
this data.</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
<p>This exercise will involve creating a review for a song, so we will use
POST, as per the principles of <a href='wad2.html'>REST</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Extend your Slim web service to include a "/review/create" route to create a review
for a particular song (defined by ID - so
include the ID as a placeholder in your route). It should read in a review, as a
POST request, connect to the database, and 
add a review for that song - there is now a "reviews" table in the "dftitutorials" database so just perform an
INSERT statement.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Sending a POST request using cURL</h2>

<p>So far we have seen how to connect to a web service using cURL to send
a GET request, however what about a POST request? </p>
<p>
Rather than adding the data to the end of the URL using a query string, you
set the <em>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</em> option with the data you want to POST.
See the example below, in which <em>$dataToPost</em> is an associative array describing a new flight.
It is 
sent to the REST URL <em>http://www.solentairways.com/flight/create</em>:
<pre>
$connection = curl_init();
curl_setopt($connection, CURLOPT_URL, "http://www.solentairways.com/flight/create");
<em>$dataToPost = 
    ["origin" =&gt; "London" ,
     "dep" =&gt; "0900",
     "arr" =&gt; "1600",
     "destination" =&gt; "New York",
     "aircraft" =&gt; "Boeing 777",
     "flightnumber" =&gt; "SA123"];</em>
curl_setopt($connection,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1);
<em>curl_setopt($connection,CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,$dataToPost);</em>
$response = curl_exec($connection);
curl_close($connection);
</pre>
would send the specified data describing
a new flight to the <em>/flight/create</em> route. <em>/flight/create</em> could
then read the various fields with with <em>$req->getParsedBody()</em>. For example:
<pre>
$app-&gt;post("/flight/create", function($req, $res, array $args) {
    $postData = $req-&gt;getParsedBody();
    // $postData["origin"] is the origin, $postData["dep"] is the departure time, etc.
});
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
<p>Return to your "fan" website from last time. On the "fan" website,
allow the user the ability to review each song <em>from HT-Tracks</em>.
This should be done by writing a new page on your fan site which connects to
the HT-Tracks download web service, which you wrote above.</p>
<br />
<img src="../images/fansite_review.png" alt="Web service clients with POST" />
<br />
</p>
<p>Do this as follows: </p> 
<ul>
<li>On your fan page, add a "review" form next to each song. This should link to a new,
as yet unwritten, script, <em>clientreview.php</em>, and have two fields:
<ul>
<li>a regular field for the review;</li>
<li>and a hidden field for the ID.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Hint</strong>: 
to create your form in your JSON-parsing loop, with a hidden field,
use this PHP:
<pre>
echo "&lt;form method='post' action='clientreview.php'&gt;";
echo "&lt;input name='review' /&gt;";
echo "&lt;input name='id' type='hidden' value='(the ID from your JSON - fill this in!)' /&gt;";
echo "&lt;input type='submit' value='review' /&gt;";
echo "&lt;/form&gt;";
</pre>
<strong>Or, alternatively,</strong> for each song on your fan page,
write a link to a separate page which should contain
a review form containing a review field, a hidden field for the ID, and an
action of <em>clientreview.php</em>.
</li>
<li>Write the new script,<em>clientreview.php</em>. 
<strong>This is part of the "fan" site, and should therefore have the same
CSS and look and feel as the main page of the "fan" site.</strong>
Write some PHP code in this script to read in the ID and the review from the form, and
send a cURL POST request to your review web service, passing the chosen review across.</li>
<li>Finally, add some <strong>error handling</strong> to your web service. If the review is blank (""), choose an
appropriate HTTP code to send back. Look at the <a href='wad2.html'>REST and Slim</a> topic for information on
how to send back a particular HTTP status code from a Slim application.</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to test the HTTP status code from a client</h3>
<p>In the last question of the exercise, you were asked to send back an HTTP status code to the client if the
review was blank. However, we have <strong>not yet looked at how you can test for an HTTP code sent back from a
remote script</strong>.
Luckily, if you are using cURL it's fairly straightforward. Once you have done your 
cURL request
you query the <em>CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE</em> property to obtain the HTTP code returned by the web service, for 
example:
<pre>
$connection = curl_init();
curl_setopt($connection, CURLOPT_URL, "http://remoteserver/script.php");
curl_setopt($connection,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1);
curl_setopt($connection,CURLOPT_HEADER,0);
$response = curl_exec($connection);
<em>
$httpCode = curl_getinfo($connection,CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
echo "The script returned the HTTP status code: $httpCode &lt;br /&gt;";
</em>
curl_close($connection);
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how the line:
<pre>curl_setopt($connection,CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);</pre>
is still present. We can get the status code without having to include
the full HTTP header in the output.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
<ol>
<li>Modify your clientreview.php to test which HTTP code is returned from
the web service and display an appropriate message accordingly.</p>
<li>Add a new route to your web service, <strong>getReviews</strong>, which returns all reviews for the song with
a particular ID as JSON. Modify your fan site to have an additional <em>reviews</em> page, which shows all reviews for 
a particular song by connecting to your web service and parsing the JSON returned. Link this reviews page to your main
fan page, so that each song has a "Review" link. Ensure the fan site's reviews page has the same look and feel as
your main fan site page.
</ol>
