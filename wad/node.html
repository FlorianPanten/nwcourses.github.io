<br />

<p><em>node.js</em> (see <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">www.nodejs.org</a>) is an increasingly popular platform which 
allows you to develop server-side applications in JavaScript. This has the a number of advantages,
for example:
    <ul>
    <li>You can use the same language to develop both client- and server-side components to your web
    application, minimising the number of languages you have to learn;</li>
    <li>A similar style of programming is used (node.js extensively uses asynchronous development with
    callbacks);</li>
    <li>JavaScript language features and APIs, such as JSON.parse() and bind(), promises (to be covered later), arrow functions, etc. will work with node.js as they do with in-browser JavaScript;</li>
    <li>Because node.js is JavaScript it is easy to exchange JSON with the client.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Installing and using node.js</h2>

<p>node.js can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">the website</a>.
It is already installed on Edward2 and Neptune. Rather than using an Apache server you
write your own custom, lightweight HTTP server with node.js running on a different port to Apache
(port 3000 is used in here).</p> 

<h3>npm</h3>

<p>Node also comes with a <em>package manager</em> called <em>npm</em>. This allows you to use add-ons to Node
(libraries) which perform additional tasks, not part of the core node.js distribution,
 such as communicating with a database. To use npm to install new packages, you enter:
 <pre>npm install &lt;packagename&gt;</pre>
 at the command-line (e.g. DOS or Linux shell prompt).</p>
 
 <h2>Logging onto the Neptune command-line and using the text
 editor</h2>
 
 <p>Because you need to <em>run</em> a node script, you need to log
 on to Neptune and use the Neptune command-line (Linux shell prompt)
as well as using FTP. To do this you should use
 <em>putty</em> (available on the lab
computers, use the search). Find putty and then
 login with the 'node' account.
 Enter the following code in Notepad++, save as <em>hello.js</em>
 and upload to your home directory
(the one <em>before</em> public_html) using FileZilla.
Or, if you prefer, create the file directly on the Neptune server using
<em>nano</em> or a similar text editor.
 <pre>console.log("Hello world!");</pre>
 On PuTTY run your
 Node.js script on the command line by entering:
<pre>node hello.js</pre>
 Hopefully this script is self-explanatory.
 <em>console.log()</em> simply writes the specified text to the
 console, so that here, for example, <em>"Hello World!"</em> is
 displayed.</p>
<h2>HTTP Servers</h2>
<p>Probably the most useful thing to learn with node.js is how
to create a lightweight <em>HTTP server</em>. With node.js, typically
you do not use Apache but instead write your own server using the
Node.js HTTP APIs. Here is a very basic HTTP server:
<pre>
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer(
    (request, response) =&gt;
    {
        response.write(`Requested with a method of ${request.method}`);
        response.end();
    }
);

server.listen(3000);
</pre>
Looking at how this works:
    <ul>
    <li>First we import the http <em>module</em>. Node comes with
    <em>modules</em> which are libraries: they provide additional
    capabilities to the Node environment. Many are provided by third
    parties. The <em>npm</em> command line tool allows you to install new
    modules. The <em>http</em> module, however, is provided with Node
    by default.</li>
    <li>Next we <em>create an HTTP server</em> with the 
    createServer() method. This returns a server object. Note how we
    <em>specify a callback function (arrow function) as a parameter to the 
    createServer() method</em>. This is an example of an 
    <em>anonymous function</em>, which you have seen already.</li>
    <li>The callback runs each time we get a request from a client.
    It takes two parameters, <em>request</em> and <em>response</em>,
    two objects representing the HTTP request and response respectively.
    Look at what it's doing: we use the <em>write()</em> method of
    the request to send some content back to the client, and then
    <em>we must finish the response by calling response.end()</em></li>
    <li>This simple example just displays what HTTP method (GET or
    POST) was used to request the server. The <em>request.method</em>
    property contains the HTTP method.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
<p>
Try running this. Rather than 3000, use your own personal port 
number. This should be a number from 3001-3099 and have the same last two 
digits as your username, e.g. if
you are wad1901, your port number would be 3001, while if you are wad1909
it would be 3009.
This is necessary as you are all creating your own personal
node servers on Neptune and therefore must each use different ports.
You'll find it goes into an infinite loop and does not return you to
the command line: this is because it is running the server continuously
listening for requests.</p>
<p>Now try sending an HTTP request to the server from your web 
browser. Enter:
<pre>http://ephp.solent.ac.uk:NNNN/</pre>
from the browser, where NNNN is your own personal port number.
You should see this output appear:
<pre>Requested with a method of: GET</pre>
because you have sent a GET request to the server.</p>
<h3>API documentation</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html">here</a> for full Node API
documentation on the HTTP module.</p>
<h2>Using Express</h2>
<p>The above example showed how to create a webserver from first principles
in Node, using the HTTP module. However, there is a very well-known Node
framework which makes the process of developing a web server, particularly
one offering REST-compliant web services, much easier - <em>Express</em>.
As is typical, Express is offered as a Node module and should be installed
with npm.
This has been installed on Neptune and Edward2 already. To give an idea of
how to install it:
<pre>npm install express</pre>
This will install it locally to your current project. Or:
<pre>sudo npm install -g express</pre>
This requires 'sudo' rights (admin privileges) on a Linux/Unix system but
will install it globally, to make it available to all projects and
all users.</p>
<h3>Hello World with Express</h3>
<p>The example below is the Hello World with Express. Note that
<em>const</em> is an ECMAScript 6 keyword for declaring a <em>constant</em>,
in other words a "variable" that cannot change.
<pre>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req,res)=&gt; {
    res.send('Hello World from Express!');
});

app.listen(3000);
</pre>
Hopefully you can see it is similar in structure to the non-Express 
web server, above. We require the express module, then create an Express
app object with <em>express()</em>.</p>
<p>Next we handle a <em>routes</em>. Routes in Express work in a very
similar way to those in Slim.  In this example we are simply handling the top 
level, 'root' route, e.g.: 
<pre>http://localhost:3000/</pre>
without any parameters supplied.</p>
<p>The handler for the route is a function which takes two parameters,
<em>req</em> representing the HTTP request and <em>res</em> representing the
HTTP response. In this example we call the <em>send()</em> method of the
response object to send back <em>Hello World from Express!</em> to the 
client.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();


app.get('/hello', (req,res)=&gt; {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});


app.get('/time', (req,res)=&gt; {
    res.send(`There have been ${Date.now()} milliseconds since 1/1/70.`);
});
app.listen(3000);
</pre>
This example sets up two routes '/hello' and '/time'. The first will
send back 'Hello World!' and the second will send back the number of 
milliseconds since January 1st 1970. You could set up <em>POST</em>
and <em>PUT</em> API endpoints (an API endpoint is a URL associated with
a web service or web API)
with <em>app.post()</em> and <em>app.put()</em>.</p>
<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
<p>Try out the example above. Run the server and request each route by
typing in the appropriate URL in your web browser.</p>
<h3>URL parameters</h3>
<p>Express allows us to easily specify URL parameters, though these are
typically passed into the URL as part of the route (REST style) rather than
via query strings e.g:
<pre>
http://localhost:3000/artist/Oasis
http://localhost:3000/artist/Madonna
</pre>
etc. You set up the route to contain named parameters and
then you can use these named parameters in your JavaScript. This example 
counts up to a named parameter: 
<pre>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();


app.get('/countTo/:ntimes', (req,res)=&gt; {
    let response = ''; // let - locally-scoped variable which can be changed
    for(var count=1; count&lt;=req.params.ntimes; count++) {
        response += `${count}&lt;br /&gt;`;
    }
    res.send(response);
});


app.listen(3000);
</pre>
Note how this will setup the route <em>/countTo</em> followed
by a parameter <em>:ntimes</em>
representing the number of times. So API endpoints such as
<pre>
http://localhost:3000/countTo/3
http://localhost:3000/countTo/6
http://localhost:3000/countTo/goat
</pre>
will be matched. (There is no check that ntimes is numeric, so the final
URL will be matched. However you can use regular expressions in Express
routes to ensure that only numbers are passed in the parameter).
</p>
<p>
To access the named parameter from the JavaScript code, use
<em>req.params.&lt;name of parameter&gt;</em>. 
So here <em>req.params.ntimes</em>
will reference the <em>:ntimes</em> parameter and the output will count from
1 to the specified parameter.</p>
<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create an Express application to set up an <em>artist</em> route.
The word <em>artist</em> should be followed by a parameter for the artist
name and the application should respond to the request with a message such
as 
<pre>You are searching for songs by Oasis</pre>
(obviously, it shouldn't always show Oasis, but whatever artist was entered
in the URL).
</li>
<li>Make the application also respond to URLs of this form:
<pre>http://localhost:3XXX/artist/Oasis/song/Wonderwall</pre>
which would display: 
<pre>You are searching for Wonderwall by Oasis</pre>
(obviously, it should respond to any title and artist, not just Wonderwall
by Oasis!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Handling POST data</h3>
<p>How do we handle POST data in Express? We can do it manually, by
examining the request, but it's much easier to use the <em>body-parser</em>
module. The <em>body-parser</em> module is a module separate to Express
(but designed for it) which can interpret the request body and extract the
POST data from it. It needs to be installed with npm separately from
Express. Here is an example:
<pre>
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true}));

app.post('/addSong', (req,res) =&gt; {
    res.send(`Adding song ${req.body.title} by ${req.body.artist}.`);
});

app.listen(3000);
</pre>
Note how we tell the app to use the body-parser module with:
<pre>app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true});</pre>
and to refer to the POST data (the equivalent of $_POST in PHP) we use:
<pre>req.body.&lt;fieldname&gt;</pre>
e.g. <em>req.body.songID</em> here to read in
an item of POST data with the name of <em>songID</em></p>
<h3>Exercise 4</h3>
<p>Try out the above example. You'll need to create a regular HTML form
with an appropriate <em>action</em> and appropriate form fields.</p>

<h3>Middleware</h3>

<p>Express (and Slim) uses the concept of <em>middleware</em>. Middleware in 
this context consists of code which runs before a request is handled,
which can modify the <em>req</em> and <em>res</em> objects. It is typically
used to prepare the request before it's handled. The <em>body-parser</em>
is actually middleware. It parses the body of the incoming HTTP request
and adds a <em>body</em> property to the <em>req</em> object allowing you
to easily access POST data. Without the middleware, the <em>body</em>
property of <em>req</em> would not exist.</p>
<p>Middleware is included with the <em>use()</em> method of your <em>app
</em> object. If you look at the POST example above you can see how
<em>use()</em> has been used to run the body-parser as middleware.
Note the <em>urlencoded()</em> method; this means the body-parser is being setup
to handle classic POST form data. An increasingly popular alternative
approach is to pass POST data as a JSON object instead (rather than named
fields); this is the approach the <em>fetch()</em> API for sending AJAX
requests (which we will look at soon) takes, for instance. 
To use body-parser to parse JSON, you would
use <em>json()</em> rather than <em>urlencoded()</em>.</p>
<p>One possible use of middleware is to add a CORS header to all responses.
In an AJAX application you will typically have a front end delivered from
a standard server (such as Apache or Nginx) on port 80, yet your Node/Express
backend will be listening on port 3000, or a similar port. This violates
the <a href='ajax.html#cors'>same-origin policy</a> and therefore you
must add an appropriate CORS header to your response.
See the exercise below.</p>

<h4>Middleware and routes</h4>
<p>We can use routes to specify that a given middleware will only
run before handling <em>a particular route</em>. This can be useful as,
we might want certain middleware to only run in response to certain
requests.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a middleware that will run on any request.
<pre>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use( (req,res,next) =&gt; {
    console.log(`Received a request at ${Date.now()} milliseconds.`);
    next();
});

app.get('/', (req,res) =&gt; {
    res.send(`Hello world!`);
});

app.listen(3000);
</pre>
Note how <em>use()</em> expects a function which takes request and response
as parameters, the same as the route handlers. This example writes a
message to the console informing the user of the time of the request.</p>
<p>Notice the call to the <em>next();</em> function (also passed as a
parameter to use()). This is necessary to
execute the next middleware (we can set up multiple items of middleware
with multiple <em>use()</em> methods) and the route handler.</p>

<p>We can also supply an optional first argument to <em>use()</em> to
specify which routes will run this middleware.
The middleware below (showing the time of the request once again)
will only run with a route of <em>search</em> followed
by a search term:
<pre>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use( '/search/:query', (req,res,next) =&gt; {
    console.log(`Received a request for /search at ${Date.now()} milliseconds.`);
    next();
});

app.get('/', (req,res) =&gt; {
    res.send(`Hello world!`);
});

app.get('/search/:query', (req,res) =&gt; {
    res.send(`Searching for ${req.params.query}...`);
});

app.listen(3000);
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Writing web services</h3>
<p>It's easy to send back JSON from an Express app, just replace
<em>send()</em> with <em>json()</em>, e.g.:
<pre>res.json({'error': 'you did not provide a search query'});</pre>
To send back status codes, use <em>status()</em>. These calls can be chained,
e.g:
<pre>res.status(400).json({'error': 'you did not provide a search query'});</pre>
</p>
<h2>Node and MySQL</h2>
<p>In this unit, we will be looking at Node and the NoSQL database MongoDB,
as they work particularly well together, and are often used together.
However, to allow you to write a useful Express application now
(a Node/Express version of your HT-Tracks web service) I'm going to 
introduce the MySQL Node module. This must be installed as a module as
usual (it has been installed on Neptune already). Very good
documentation is available <a href='https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql'>here</a>.
</p>

<p>To summarise using the MySQL Node module:
<ul>
<li>Connecting to the database is as follows. Note the callback-based,
asynchronous approach; the <em>connect()</em> method takes a callback 
function as an argument which runs as soon as we are connected. This callback
will receive an <em>err</em> parameter if there was an error.
<pre>
const con = mysql.createConnection({
        host: 'localhost',
        user: 'dftitutorials',
        database: 'dftitutorials',
        password: 'dftitutorials'});

con.connect( err=&gt; {
            if(err) {
                   console.log(`Error connecting to mysql: ${err}`);
            } else { 
                console.log('connected to mysql ok');
                //  now we have a successful connection, query the database..
            }
        });
</pre>
</li>
<li>Performing a SELECT statement is as follows. Note how it's callback-based
again: the first argument to <em>query()</em> is the query, the second an
array of the bound parameters (using prepared statements), and the third is
a <em>callback</em> which runs when the query has returned results. 
This callback has three parameters: an error (if there is one); the results
(an array of objects, one object for each record) and the database fields.
<pre>
con.query(`SELECT * FROM students WHERE lastname=?`,
    [lastname], (error,results,fields) =&gt; { 
        if(error) {
            console.log(`Error with mysql statement: details: ${JSON.stringify(error)}`);
        } else {
            results.forEach (result=&gt; {
                console.log(`Name ${result.name} Course ${result.course} Grade: ${result.grade}`); 
            });
        }
    });
</pre>
Note how we loop through the results, add the details of each result to a 
string variable, and then write that variable to the console.
</li>
<li>Performing an UPDATE statement uses the same approach:
<pre>
con.query(`UPDATE products SET quantity=quantity-1 WHERE id=?`, [productId], (error,results,fields)=&gt; {
    if(results.affectedRows==1) {
        console.log('You bought it successfully.');
    } else {
        console.log('Unable to update, is there a product with that ID?');
    }
} );
</pre>
Note how we use the <em>affectedRows</em> property of the results object to
determine whether any results were updated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing a custom module to easily connect to MySQL</h3>

<p>The above examples show a potential issue with using the Node MySQL
module: it's callback based, so the code ends up relatively complex.
This means that, to integrate MySQL into an Express application, you'd
need to connect to MySQL first and then put your Express code in the
MySQL connection callback. This makes your code perhaps rather messy and
convoluted. A better approach is to <em>create your own Node module</em>
and put the connection code in that. Here is an example:
<pre>
// File - mysqlconn.js
const mysql = require('mysql');

const con = mysql.createConnection({
        host: 'localhost',
        user: 'dftitutorials',
        database: 'dftitutorials',
        password: 'dftitutorials'});

        con.connect( err=&gt; {
            if(err) {
                   console.log(err);
                process.exit(1); // exit the server
            } else { 
                console.log('connected to mysql ok');
            }
        });
    
<em>module.exports = con;</em>
</pre>
Note how we have created a file <em>mysqlconn.js</em> which connects to
the database. Note the final line as this is key:
<pre>module.exports=con;</pre>
This <em>exports</em> the variable <em>con</em> (representing the connection)
to the outside world. This is how we can define a Node module; write some
code and then <em>export</em> an object to the outside world.</p>
<p>To use our custom module in our Express application, we use 
<em>require()</em> in the same way that we imported third-party modules:
<pre>const con = <em>require('./mysqlconn');</em></pre>
The variable <em>con</em> will represent our MySQL connection. Note how
it's set equal to the return value of <em>require()</em>; this will be
whatever was exported from our module. Also note the module name
<em>./mysqlconn</em> and how this corresponds to the module filename
<em>mysqlconn.js</em>; the <em>./</em> means the current directory.</p>

<h3>Using a module to define your routes</h3>
<p>In a larger application, you will quickly find that your main Express
file (often index.js or app.js)
will become very large, handling a large number of routes. What you
can do instead is to define a <em>Router</em>. A router allows you to set
up a group of routes which match a particular path. For example we might
create a router matching <em>/songs</em> which will handle any routes
beginning with <em>/songs</em>, e.g:
<em>/songs/all</em>, <em>/songs/id/:id</em> and so on. To do this we
create a <em>routes</em> directory and place a route handler in there, which
would be a Node module.
Here is an example router module (<em>song.js</em>) which we would save in
our <em>routes</em> directory:
<pre>
const express = require('express');
// song.js
const song = express.Router();

song.get('/all', (req,res)=&gt; {
    // code to return all songs
});

song.get('/id/:id', (req,res)=&gt; {
    // code to find the song with the given ID
});

module.exports = song; // export the module for external use
</pre>
Then, in your main Express app, you could <em>use</em> the router as
follows:
<pre>
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Import our song router module which we created above
const songRouter = require('./routes/song');

// Tell the app to use songRouter for all routes beginning with /songs
// As we are using "use()", the router is acting as a middleware.
app.use('/songs', songRouter);
app.listen(3000);
</pre>
So the song router is imported from the <em>routes/song</em> module
(corresponding to routes/song.js) and then we call <em>use()</em> (note how
the router is acting as a middleware) with two arguments:
    <ul>
    <li><em>/songs</em>, indicating that this router will match all URLs
    beginning with <em>/songs</em>;</li>
    <li>The router object itself.</li>
    </ul>
So, the route <em>/songs/all</em> will be resolved via the song
router (as the route begins with /songs) and then finding the /all route
within there.</p>
<h2>Exercise 5</h2>
<p>Write a version of your HT-Tracks search web service 
using Node.js and Express. The search web service should respond
to the route:
<pre>/artist/&lt;artist name&gt;</pre>
Connect your AJAX search from Topic 6 to your Node/Express
search web service. <strong>While your Express application will be stored
in your folder on the 'node' account, the front-end should be uploaded to
your public_html on Neptune (not Edward2!) as normal. You have an Neptune
FTP account which has the same login details as your Edward2 account.</strong>
</p>
<p>The same MySQL database tables are present on Neptune, here are the 
details:
    <ul>
    <li>Username: wad</li>
    <li>Password: wad</li>
    <li>Database: wad</li>
    <li>Table: wadsongs</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Output plain text first, and then convert it to output JSON. Note that
the 'results' parameter is an array of objects.
<strong>Use a module to connect to MySQL</strong>, as in the example 
above - it will make your code easier to follow.</p>
<p>If you do that successfully, 
implement your 'order' web service (Topic 7, DOM) using Express
(in the same application as your search service).
</p>
<p>Things you'll need to know for this:
<ul>
<li>The response object <em>res</em> has a <em>status()</em> method which
can be used to send back any HTTP status code.</li>
<li>The response object also has a <em>set</em> method which can be used
to set a particular HTTP header in the response. You'll need this for CORS
as <em>your AJAX front end will be served from a standard Apache server
while the back-end is your Node server, on a different port</em> so the
<a href='ajax.html#cors'>same-origin policy</a>
applies. You'll need something like: (<strong>where should this go?</strong>)
<pre>res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://ephp.solent.ac.uk');</pre>
</li>
<li>Add your routes to an external router module, as shown above.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Finally - deploying a live Node app</h2>
<h3>Using a reverse proxy to access your app</h3>
<p>What happens when you want to deploy a Node.js application to production?
If it's running on port 3000, it will not be accessible to the outside
world (for security reasons it's not a good idea to open up non-standard
ports), which means you need to provide a 'backdoor' 
means for the outside world to
access it. A common approach is to use a conventional web
server (on port 80)
as a 'reverse proxy' so that requests which match a particular URL
will be routed to your Node application on port 3000. With Apache you 
can do this using the <em>mod_proxy</em> module. 
An alternative commonly used web server on Node-based systems is <em>Nginx</em>.
DigitalOcean have an article on this: <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04'>here</a>.</p>
<h3>PM2 - Node process manager</h3>
<p>The other issue when deploying a Node app to production is stability of
your Node server. If you just use the "node" command line to launch your
Node app, it will just "die" if it crashes and will not be resurrected. To
get round this you can use <em>pm2</em> (see <a href='http://pm2.keymetrics.io'>here; warning, doesn't seem to load on Firefox</a>), 
which is a process manager typically used with Node applications, though it
can also be used to manage other background processes.
With pm2, you can launch a Node process in the background, 
stop it, start it and monitor
how it is running. Furthermore if the process crashes, pm2 will restart
it.</p>
<p>PM2 has already been installed on Neptune. It can be installed with 
npm, for example this command will install it globally
for all users if you are logged in as a user with admin privileges on a 
Linux system:
<pre>sudo npm install -g pm2</pre>
To start a given Node server with PM2 you use this command:
<pre>pm2 start name_of_file.js</pre>
You can list all processes managed with PM2 with:
<pre>pm2 list</pre>
Note that each process is allocated a <em>name</em> (the filename minus the
.js extension) and an <em>ID</em> (which is useful if two processes with the
same name exist). <em>pm2 list</em> also gives information about the CPU
and memory usage of each process.</p>
<p>You can stop a running process with:
<pre>pm2 stop process_name_or_process_id</pre>
This will, however, leave it in the list of managed processes. To completely
delete it, you would use:
<pre>pm2 delete process_name_or_process_id</pre>
</p>
