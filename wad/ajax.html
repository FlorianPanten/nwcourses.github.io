<p>Today we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unobtrusive JavaScript and Arrow Functions</li>
<li>AJAX</li>
<li>Using JSON in AJAX applications</li>
</ul>
<h2>JavaScript Revision</h2>
<p>Remember from the first year that JavaScript is a language to develop interactive, rich client-side
applications. Many websites these days are similar to traditional standalone desktop applications
(think of Google Docs, etc) and rely on large amounts of JavaScript to implement this functionality.</p>

<p>JavaScript is typically stored in external <em>.js</em> files, and included into web pages with
&lt;script&gt; tags. Here is a simple hello world example, which shows a "Hello World" alert box:
<pre>function init() {
    alert("Hello World!")
}</pre>
You'd save this in an external file, e.g. <em>script.js</em> and then include it in your website:
<pre>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='script.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
</p>
<p>Here is a full web page which runs this JavaScript when the page first loads:
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='script.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body <strong>onload='init()'</strong>&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Test JavaScript Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
</p>
<h3>Unobtrusive JavaScript: Event Handlers with Arrow Functions</h3>
<p>Previously, it was common to link buttons and other user interface elements
to JavaScript event handlers (functions which run when the button was clicked) directly within
the HTML code. However, this leads to a messy and hard-to-read mix of HTML and JavaScript.
It is better, instead, to write <em>unobtrusive JavaScript</em> in which user interface
elements are linked to JavaScript event handlers when the page first loads. Here is an example of some
JavaScript which does just this. Note how in the <em>init()</em> function (which runs when the page
first loads) we link the button with the ID of <em>btn1</em> to an event handler.
<pre>
// JavaScript file, script2.js
function init() {
    document.getElementById("btn1").addEventListener("click", clickHandler);
}
    
function clickHandler() {
    alert("You clicked me!");
}
</pre>
The accompanying HTML might look like this:
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='script2.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body <strong>onload='init()'</strong>&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Test JavaScript Event Handling Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;input type='button' id='btn1' value='Click me!' /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
Note how in our <em>init()</em> function we add an <em>event listener</em> to our button,
<em>btn1</em>. An event listener is a function which runs in response to an event (such as the user
clicking a button).</p>
<p>Note that <em>addEventListener()</em> takes two parameters:
    <ul>
    <li>"click" - this is the type of event we're listening for (a click, in this case)</li>
    <li>the <em>event handler</em>. This is the function we want to run when the event occurs
    (here, the <em>clickHandler()</em> function). When we pass functions as parameters to 
    other functions like this, they are known as <em>callbacks</em>. A callback is a function
    that will run at some future point in time (in this example, when the button is clicked)
    rather than when the code is first executed.
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Arrow functions</h3>
<p>Arrow functions are a new feature of the recent JavaScript standard,
ECMAScript 6. They are anonymous, nameless functions which can be used 
as parameters where a callback function is expected. Rather than writing the callback
function as a separate function, and specifying the name of the callback as a parameter, we write the function in full 
where the callback is expected. Here is the JavaScript example above
rewritten so that the callback is an arrow function. Note also how we do not use the
word "function" with arrow functions, but separate the parameter list and
function body with the arrow operator (<em>=&gt;</em>):
<pre>
// JavaScript file, script2a.js
function init() {
    document.getElementById("btn1").addEventListener("click", <strong>()=&gt; 
        { 
            alert("You clicked me!") 
        } </strong>
    );
}</pre>
Notice how this time, rather than creating a named function called <em>clickHandler()</em>, we pass in an 
anonymous, arrow function as the second parameter to <em>addEventListener()</em>. Note the syntax of the arrow function:
<pre>() =&gt; 
{
    alert("You clicked me!");
}</pre>
The <em>()</em> is the parameter list to the arrow function (here, the function takes no parameters). We follow the
parameter list with the arrow operator (=&gt;) and then write the body of the function, beginning and ending with braces { }
in the same way as normal functions.</p>
<h3>Revisiting AJAX</h3>

<p><img src="../images/ajax2.png" alt="AJAX applications"/></p>
<p>
AJAX stands for 
<em>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</em>. 
It is a technique which allows browsers to communicate with a web server <em>without having to reload the page</em>. </p>
<p>
A user might enter a search term in a form and click Go, and then the search results would be sent back from the server and 
<em>one small part of the page only</em>
 (as opposed to the entire page) updated with the search results. </p>

<p>
Furthermore, requests to the server are sent, and responses received, 
<em>in the background without any interruption to the user's interaction with the website...</em>
 so, unlike in a traditional web application where the user has to wait for a response from the server, the user can 
<em>continue to interact with the page</em>
 while waiting for the response to come back.</p>

<p>
AJAX is not an actual language, but a combination of technologies used to produce the effect above. An AJAX application typically 
consists of three components:
<ul>
<li>
the client side application, usually JavaScript running in the browser which sends HTTP requests to a server and processes the response;</li>
<li>
a server side script which receives the HTTP request sent from the JavaScript, above, and delivers the response;</li>
<li>
the data sent back from the server to the client, which can be either 
plain text or a data description format such as JSON or XML.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The AJAX process typically works as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>The user interacts with the page in some way, e.g. clicks a search button. A JavaScript function sends a request
    to the server.</li>
    <li>The server side script runs.</li>
    <li>Another JavaScript function, called the <em>callback</em>, receives the data sent back from the server, processes it, and
    integrates the results within the front-end.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Writing AJAX code</h3>

<p>In ECMAScript 6, a new AJAX API is available - the fetch API. This makes it easier to write AJAX applications
compared to previously. However, it does make use of a feature of ECMAScript 6 called <em>promises</em> which we will 
return to later, and therefore, at the moment might be a little difficult to understand given we haven't covered
promises yet.</p>
<p>
So for now, we will use the older API ('XMLHttpRequest2') but we will cover the fetch API later.
<pre>// JavaScript file, ajax1.js
function init() {
    
        
        // For simplicity, we're specifying that when the button clicks,
        // a regular callback function 'sendAjax' will run, rather than an arrow function.
        // This is because we are using an arrow function in our AJAX code as well, and I don't
        // want to overcomplicate things at this stage by having too many arrow functions inside other arrow functions!
        
        document.getElementById("btn1").addEventListener("click", sendAjax);
            
}
    
function sendAjax() {
        // Read in the input from the two form fields
        var a = document.getElementById('destination').value;
        var b = document.getElementById('date').value;
        
        // Set up our AJAX connection variable (this is an object, for those of you who have done OO programming)
        var ajaxConnection = new XMLHttpRequest();
    
        // Set up the callback function. Here, the callback is an arrow function.
        ajaxConnection.addEventListener ("load",e =&gt; 
            { 
                 var output = ""; // initialise output to blank text
                 var allFlights = JSON.parse(e.target.responseText);

                 // Loop through each 
                 allFlights.forEach( curFlight =&gt; 
                        {
                            // add the details of the current flight to the "output" variable
                            output = output + `Flight number: ${curFlight.number} Depart: ${curFlight.depart} Arrive: ${curFlight.arrive} &lt;br /&gt; `;
                        } );
                // Put the HTML output into the results div (up to you to do!)        
            });
    
   
        // Open the connection to a given remote URL.
        ajaxConnection.open("GET" , `https://example.com/flights.php?destination=${a}&amp;date=${b}`);
    
        // Send the request.
        ajaxConnection.send();
}
</pre>
with this HTML:
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='ajax1.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body onload='init()'&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Test AJAX Page&lt;/h1&gt;
Destination: &lt;input id='destination' /&gt;
Date: &lt;input id='date' /&gt;
&lt;input type='button' id='btn1' value='Search for flights!!' /&gt;
&lt;div id='responseDiv'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

How does this work?  
    <ul>
    <li>In our <em>init()</em> function, we connect the button to the <em>sendAjax()</em> function.</li>
    <li>The sendAjax() function first retrieves the 
    destination and date that the user entered and stores them in the variables
    <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> respectively.</li>
    <li>We create a variable <em>ajaxConnection</em> to represent the AJAX connection with the server.
    (For those of you who have done object-oriented programming, this is an object of type <em>XMLHttpRequest</em>).</li>
    <li>We specify what function to run when the response has been received 
    (the <em>callback function</em>) by adding a "load" event listener to our AJAX connection variable:
    <pre>ajaxConnection.addEventListener ("load", callback function);</pre>
    This means that when the response has been received (the <em>load</em> event has occurred), the 
    callback function will run. Here, the callback function is an arrow function; we will return to it    
    later.</li>
    <li>We then <em>open the connection to the server</em> with this line:
<pre>xhr2.open("GET", `https://example.com/flights.php?destination=${a}&amp;date=${b}`);</pre>
    Note how we are dynamically creating the query string using the form data, and specifying a
    <em>GET</em> request. <strong>Note the use of backticks (`) here</strong>. This is a new
    syntax introduced in ECMAScript 6. Using backticks
    for a string allows us to embed variables and expressions within the string by preceding the 
    variable or expression with a dollar and surrounding it in braces { } (e.g. ${a} here).</li>
    <li>Finally we actually <em>send</em> the request:
    <pre>ajaxConnection.send();</pre>
    </li>

    </ul>

<h2>Using JSON in an AJAX application</h2>

<p>We will now discuss what the callback function
does, but before we do so we need to discuss how JSON parsing works in
JavaScript.</p>
<p>
JSON is most commonly used in conjunction with AJAX. An AJAX application can make a request to a server side script which generates JSON 
from the contents of a database, and then interpret the JSON returned. We can then convert the JSON
into JavaScript <em>arrays</em> and <em>objects</em>. (Remember that an <em>object</em> is a code representation of
a real-world entity; here, our objects are flights). For example, imagine that
this JSON code is returned from the server in the above example if the usersearched for flights from Gatwick to Rome.
<pre>
[
    {
        "origin" : "Gatwick",
        "destination": "Rome",
        "number" : "EU901",
        "depart"  : "0900",
        "arrive" : "1200"
    } ,

    { 
        "origin" : "Gatwick",
        "destination": "Rome",
        "number" : "EU903",
        "depart"  : "1100",
        "arrive" : "1400"
    } ,

    { 
        "origin" : "Gatwick",
        "destination": "Rome",
        "number" : "EU905",
        "depart"  : "1400",
        "arrive" : "1700"
    }
]
</pre>
This JSON code, an array of three objects, can be converted into the
JavaScript equivalent, a <em>JavaScript array of three JavaScript objects</em>,
using the <em>JSON.parse()</em> function. 
A <em>JavaScript object</em> is similar to a PHP associative array - 
we will look at objects in more detail later in the unit.</p>
<p>We use the <em>JSON.parse()</em> function to convert
JSON into the corresponding JavaScript arrays and objects. We will now return to our
callback function (highlighted below):
<pre>
ajaxConnection.addEventListener ("load",<strong>e =&gt; 
{ 
    var output = ""; // initialise output to blank text
    var allFlights = JSON.parse(e.target.responseText);
    allFlights.forEach( curFlight =&gt; 
        {
            // add the details of the current flight to the "output" variable
            output = output + `Flight number: ${curFlight.number} Depart: ${curFlight.depart} Arrive: ${curFlight.arrive} &lt;br /&gt; `;
    } );
    
}</strong>);
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Firstly notice how the callback arrow function has a parameter, <em>e</em>. This represents an
<em>event object</em> (we will return to these later). <em>e.target</em> represents the
original <em>ajaxConnection</em> variable that we used to make the connection, in other words it's an object
of type XMLHttpRequest. From this, we can actually obtain the text of the response from the server
with <em>e.target.responseText</em>.</li>
<li>Also notice how <strong>in arrow functions, parameters are not surrounded by
parentheses.</strong/>.</li>
<li>We parse the response, <em>e.target.responseText</em>, into an array of JavaScript objects using
JSON.parse().</li>
<li>We then perform a <em>forEach()</em> on the array. <em>forEach()</em> is a function which performs a second function on each member of
an array. Each member of the array in turn is passed into this second function as a parameter. Here, the second function
is itself an arrow function, which takes the current flight as a parameter:
<pre>allFlights.forEach( <strong>curFlight =&gt; 
        {
            // add the details of the current flight to the "output" variable
            output = output + `Flight number: ${curFlight.number} Depart: ${curFlight.depart} Arrive: ${curFlight.arrive} &lt;br /&gt; `;
    }</strong>);</pre>
As <em>curFlight</em> represents the current flight, we can obtain its properties with <em>curFlight.number</em>,
<em>curFlight.depart</em> and <em>curFlight.arrive</em>. So for each flight, we add its details to the variable 
<em>output</em>. Therefore, once we've done each flight, <em>output</em> will contain all flights.
You'd then place the results inside a page element such as a &lt;div&gt;, but I've left that for you to do.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='cors'>The same-origin policy</h2>



<p>AJAX applications are normally subject to the <em>same-origin policy</em>. This means that the back-end
(the server-side script that the JavaScript talks to) must be delivered from the same exact domain as
the front-end. The reason for this is security: the ability for an AJAX front end to talk to 
a third-party server opens up the possibility of cross-site scripting.
According to the W3C on their <a href='http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy'>
same origin policy document</a>, with the same-origin policy "the overarching intent is to let users visit untrusted web sites 
without those web sites interfering with the user's session with honest web sites" - in other words,
it prevents the possibility of a third-party 
AJAX-based site using AJAX to communicate with a legitimate site which the user might be currently
logged on to, which could lead to stealing of session-specific information.</p>
<p>
The domain must be exact; subdomains of a top-level domain are treated as different.
For example <em>booking.solentholidays.com</em> and
<em>hotels.solentholidays.com</em> are treated as different. This is because several users with different
subdomains might be sharing the same top-level domain of a hosting company, e.g.
<em>fredsmith.solenthosting.com</em> and <em>timjones.solenthosting.com</em>.</p>

<h3>Circumventing the same-origin policy with CORS</h3>
<p>There is, however, a way in which server-side developers can circumvent the same origin policy in
certain cases. This is done by explicitly allowing, on the server side, certain AJAX clients to connect.
A common case is where one person owns two domains, and would like the two domains to
communicate with each other over AJAX. For example, Solent Holidays might have two domains,
<em>hotels.solentholidays.com</em> and <em>booking.solentholidays.com</em>
 - and wishes to be able to send users' booking details from
<em>booking.solentholidays.com</em> to a hotels web service on <em>hotels.solentholidays.com</em>. To do this, they would have to 
add code
to the server-side scripts on <em>hotels.solentholidays.com</em> to <em>allow booking.solentholidays.com to connect</em>.
</p>
<p>This is done by using the technique of 
<em>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</em>.
An <em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> line is added to the HTTP response from the PHP script
using the <em>header()</em> function, e.g. PHP scripts on <em>hotels.solentholidays.com</em> could include the following:
<pre>&lt;?php
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: booking.solentholidays.com");
... rest of script ... </pre>
</p>

<h3>AJAX and JSON Parsing - Exercise</h3>

<p>The main exercise is to write a website for HT-Tracks including an AJAX 
front end which <em>parses</em>
(interprets) the JSON that your web service from the first week produced.
The Standard Questions are the most important to complete. </p>
<h4>Standard Questions</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that your HT-Tracks page (which you should have done as homework)
includes a form field to allow the user to enter an artist,
and a button, as in the flights example, above.
	<ul>
	<li>If you don't have an HT-Tracks page, download this one from
	<a href='resources/index.html'>here</a>.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>In a separate JavaScript file, write an AJAX request function which connects to
your web service from session 2. You should <em>parse</em> the JSON returned.
Place the results within a &lt;div&gt;. Remember that you can use <em>innerHTML</em>
to fill a page element, e.g:
<pre>document.getElementById("div1").innerHTML = "New content!";</pre></li>
</ol>
</p>
<h4>More advanced questions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Display the results in a table.</li>
<li>Move on to the <a href='DOM.html'>next topic</a>. If you begin this now,
you will have more chance of completing all the advanced questions in that
topic.</li>
</ol>
