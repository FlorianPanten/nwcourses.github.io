<h1>Topic 9 - JavaScript Prototypes and Classes</h1>
<h2>Important!</h2>
<p>This topic is only intended for students who are up-to-date. You must 
complete Topics 1-4, and 6-8,before you attempt this.</p>
<p>In this topic we will look at JavaScript <em>prototypes</em>.</p>
<h2>Constructors and Prototypes</h2>
<p>In the first session this week
we looked at JavaScript <a href='objects.html'>objects</a>.
However, there was a problem in which we were unable to easily
set up <em>many versions of similar objects</em>, such as many cats which all have different names but all work
in the same way, i.e. all have the same methods. 
From what we have seen already, the only way of doing this is to add the methods (such as
<em>eat()</em>, <em>walk()</em> and <em>makeNoise()</em>) to <em>every single object of a given type</em> (e.g. every single
cat). Clearly, this
is inefficient and time-consuming, as the following code illustrates:
<pre>var cat = {
        name: "Tiddles",
        age: 10,
        weight: 10,
    
        makeNoise: function()
        {
            alert("Meow!");
        },

        walk: function()
        {
            // "--" reduces the weight by 1
            this.weight--;
        },

        eat: function()
        {
            // "++" increases the weight by 1
            this.weight++;
        }

    };

var cat2 = {
        name: "Tom",
        age: 5,
        weight: 5,
    
        makeNoise: function()
        {
            alert("Meow!");
        },

        walk: function()
        {
            // "--" reduces the weight by 1
            this.weight--;
        },

        eat: function()
        {
            // "++" increases the weight by 1
            this.weight++;
        }

    };
    
    </pre>
To create two cats with different properties, we have to <em>repeat the code for the methods</em>
which is inefficient as the methods work in the same way for each cat.
This topic will examine how we can get round this problem.</p>
<h3>The Constructor</h3>
<p>If you have had experience of other object-orientated languages, you will have come across the
<em>constructor</em>. The constructor is a special method used to define <em>how objects are created</em>.
In JavaScript, the constructor works <em>in a different way to other languages</em>. It is <em>an ordinary
function</em> which is used to create objects when <em>used together with the "new" keyword</em>. What do we
mean by this? Consider this function which could be used as a possible constructor:
<pre>
function Cat(n, a)
{
    this.name = n;
    this.age = a;
}
</pre>
When <em>used with new</em>, this constructor
function can be used to create new Cats. It takes two parameters, n (the name)
and a (the age), and sets the <em>name</em> and <em>age</em> properties of objects created using this constructor
to those two parameters. (<em>"this"</em> refers to the object that will be created with the constructor). 
So we could use the constructor function to create two new Cat objects:
<pre>
<em>
var cat1 = new Cat("Tiddles", 10);
var cat2 = new Cat("Tigger", 7);
</em>
// Display the cats to show that it worked
alert(cat1.name + " " + cat1.age);
alert(cat2.name + " " + cat2.age);
</pre>
When the <em>new</em> keyword is used in code together with a function name (e.g. <em>Cat</em>) this tells JavaScript
to <em>create a new object</em> using the specified function (Cat here). Note that unlike other languages,
Cat is <em>not</em> a data type. It is simply a function name. </p>
<p>In fact, one could call Cat just like a regular function, but it wouldn't do a lot in that case. For instance
the code
<pre>
var cat1 = Cat("Tiddles",10); // <em>note no "new"</em>
</pre>
would be perfectly legal JavaScript, but wouldn't do anything, unless the Cat function returned something, in which
case the variable <em>cat1</em> would be assigned the return value of the Cat function.</p>
<h2>Prototypes</h2>
<p>The problem we have so far is that we have to <em>repeat code</em>
for several objects of a similar type. This also has the effect of
<em>creating multiple copies of methods in memory for each object of that
type</em>, which is very memory-inefficient. We can get round this problem
using <em>prototypes</em>.</p>
<p> Constructor functions have a special property, <em>prototype</em>, which defines a "blueprint" or "template"
object to use when creating new objects with that constructor. (How can a function, such as the constructor,
have properties? In
JavaScript, functions are a form of object, so because a function is an object, it can have properties).
So we can define a prototype for cats, by assigning properties and methods to the <em>prototype</em> property of
the Cat constructor, and then create many Cats which use that prototype.
<strong>Then, only one copy of these shared properties and methods need
be stored in memory.</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The code below shows this:
<pre>
function Cat(n,a,w)
{
    this.name=n;
    this.age=a;
    this.weight=w;
}


<em>Cat.prototype.species = "Felis catus";
Cat.prototype.nLegs = 4;
Cat.prototype.makeNoise = function() { alert("Meow!"); };
Cat.prototype.eat = function() { this.weight++; };</em>
</pre>
Note how we use the <em>prototype</em> property of the constructor function, Cat. The prototype property represents <em>the prototype of all
objects created with this constructor function</em>, in other words the prototype property of <em>all cats</em>.
So, all cats will have a prototype containing:
    <ul>
    <li>A species property of "Felis catus";</li>
    <li>a nLegs property of 4;</li>
    <li>a <em>makeNoise()</em> method which displays "Meow!" in an alert box.</li>
    <li>an <em>eat()</em> method.</li>
    </ul>
It should be noted that the prototype is <em>not</em> part of the individual cat objects themselves. It is a 
<em>separate</em> object which is shared between all objects created with the Cat constructor, i.e. all cat objects.
The diagram
below illustrates this.</p>
<p><img src="../images/prototypes1.png" alt="Object prototypes" /></p>

<p>We can prove that the prototype works with the following code:
<pre>
function Cat(n,a,w)
{
    this.name=n;
    this.age=a;
    this.weight=w;
}

// Setup the prototype in the "global" area, outside any functions
Cat.prototype.species = "Felis catus";
Cat.prototype.nLegs = 4;
Cat.prototype.makeNoise = function() { alert("Meow!"); };
Cat.prototype.eat = function() { this.weight++; };

// Function to test creating objects with prototypes - might be linked to a button
function testprototypes()
{
    var cat1 = new Cat("Tiddles", 10, 10);
    var cat2 = new Cat("Tigger", 7, 8);

    alert(cat1.species); // "Felis catus"
    alert(cat2.species); // "Felis catus"
    cat1.makeNoise(); // "Meow!"
    cat2.makeNoise(); // "Meow!"
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how, even though <em>makeNoise()</em> and <em>species</em> are part of the <em>prototype</em>, we can
access them directly using simply the object name plus the method or property, for example <em>cat1.makeNoise()</em>
(we don't have to use something like <em>cat1.getPrototype().makeNoise()</em>). The reason for this is given under
the discussion on "prototype chaining", in the further notes on prototypes.</p>
<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
<p>Return to your car exercise from the <a href='objects.html'>objects topic</a>.
    <ol>
    <li>Create a <em>Car</em> constructor which takes parameters for the make, model, engine capacity, and
    top speed, and sets up corresponding properties. It should also set a <em>currentSpeed</em> property to 0.</li>
    <li>Set up a <em>prototype</em> object belonging to the <em>Car</em> constructor and
    containing all the car methods you wrote last time, in other words,
    <em>toString()</em>, <em>accelerate()</em>, <em>decelerate()</em>, and so on.</li>
    <li>Test it out by creating two car objects which use this prototype, and doing things with them, such
    as accelerating, decelerating and displaying them.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Above we looked at <em>prototypes</em> as a way of creating several objects of a similar
type, for example several cats. The only issue with prototypes is that the code can be rather 
messy and hard to understand, and common object-oriented concepts such as inheritance are hard to implement. 
Thus, ECMAScript 6 introduced <em>classes</em> to JavaScript, 
which work in a similar way to classes in full object-oriented languages such as Java.</p>
<p>Note that it is important to understand that <em>JavaScript doesn't use real classes</em>, in the way that other
languages such as Java do. JavaScript classes are "syntactic sugar" (as stated
in the Mozilla article, below), round JavaScript's real underlying
object mechanism, prototypes, which we looked at above.</p>
<h3>Classes and Objects</h3>
<p>So far we've looked at objects, but object-oriented programming also
features the concept of <em>classes</em>.
As of ECMAScript 6, you can use classes in JavaScript. What is a class?
It is a general description, or blueprint, of something while an 
object is a particular example, or instance, of that class. 
For example:
    <ul>
    <li>Dog is a class; Lassie, Fido and Bowser are Dog objects.</li>
    <li>Popstar is a class; Madonna and Michael Jackson are Popstar objects.</li>
    <li>Room is a class; RM602, RM603, RM605 and RM607 are Room objects.</li>
    <li>Country is a class; the UK and Germany are Country objects.</li>
    </ul>

<p>More detail can be found on the
<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes'>
Mozilla page</a>.
</p>
<p>Here is a simple example where we define a class representing a student.
<pre>

<em>
class Student
{

    
    // constructor
    constructor(nameIn,courseIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.course = courseIn;
    }

    display()
    {
        alert(`Name ${this.name} Course ${this.course}`);"
    }
}
</em>

function init() 
{
    var student1 = new Student("John" , "Software Engineering");
    var student2 = new Student("Surjan" , "Web Design");
    student1.display();
    student2.display();
}
</pre>
<p>
<p>How does the example work?
<ul>
<li>
The actual Student class is the section of code highlighted.</li>
<li>We create a class called Student and then define the <em>constructor</em>
 with constructor(). What is the constructor?
It's a special function which runs when we create a new object of that class. 
It initialises two properties - name and course - to a name and course passed in from outside as parameters.</li>
<li>Note that <em>this</em> is a reference to the current object, so we're
setting the name and course properties of the current Student object we're
dealing with.
</li>
<li> The highlighted code does not create any objects; it merely defines how a Student class works.
</li>
<li>
The actual object creation is
done instead in the code below:
<pre>
var student1 = new Student("John" , "Software Engineering");
var student2 = new Student("Surjan" , "Web Design");
</pre>

<li>
Note the use of the keyword <em>new</em> 
to create new objects of the Student class. Two new objects, student1 and student2, are created. 
</li>
<li>When we create a Student object, the constructor (see above) is called to initialise the objects.
</li>
<li> Note how, for the first object, we pass the values "John" and "Software Engineering" to the constructor. The parameters to the 
constructor, nameIn and courseIn, will take on the values "John" and "Software Engineering" 
respectively, as these are the two pieces of information that have been passed in. The constructor then 
sets the name and course attributes to these two values. </li>
<li>
Therefore, the object student1 will have a name attribute of "John" and a course attribute of 
"Software Engineering".</li>
<li>Finally we call each student's display() method:
<pre>
student1.display();
student2.display();
</pre>
As can be seen from the class, the display method displays the details of that student.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Another example: a Dog class</h3>
<pre>

class Dog
{
    constructor(nameIn, weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }

    display()
    {
        alert(`${this.name} ${this.weight}`);
    }

    walk()
    {
        if(this.weight &gt; 10)
        {
           this.weight--; // reduce weight by 1
        }
        else
        {                
            alert("The poor dog will be half starved if you carry on!");
        }
    }
}

function init()
{
    var dog1 = new Dog("Fido", 11);
    var dog2 = new Dog("Lassie", 13);
    dog1.display();
    dog2.display();
    dog1.walk();
    dog1.display();
    dog1.walk();
    dog1.display();
}

?&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Note how the walk() method of Dog is defined in the class. It simulates walking the dog by reducing the 
weight by one, but if the weight goes below 10, the dog refuses to walk as he/she doesn't want to starve!!!</p>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Often, we might wish to code several related classes</li>
<li>For instance, we might code classes for Car, Bus and Bike</li>
<li>Since cars, buses and bikes are all related (they are all vehicles),
we will probably end up repeating code in all three classes</li>
<li>A solution is to use <em>inheritance</em></li>
<li>We could create a <em>Vehicle</em> class, containing the common
actions of all vehicles, and then <em>inherit</em> Car, Bus and Bike
from Vehicle</li>
<li>Each <em>subclass</em> (Car, Bus, Bike) would <em>inherit</em> code
from the <em>superclass</em> Vehicle, 
and add its own specific code, preventing code repetition
between classes</li>
<li>The syntax for JavaScript class inheritance is very similar to that of Java</li>
</ul>
<pre>
// Vehicle.js
class Vehicle 
{

    constructor(makeIn, topSpeedIn, nWheelsIn)
    { 
        this.make = makeIn;
        this.topSpeed = topSpeedIn;
        this.nWheels = nWheelsIn;
    }

    move()
    {
       alert("Moving along...");
    }

    display()
    {
        alert(`${this.make} ${this.topSpeed} ${this.nWheels}`);
    }
}
</pre>
<pre>
// Bike.js

class Bike extends Vehicle 
{
    constructor(makeIn, topSpeedIn, offRoadIn, nGearsIn)
    {
<em>
        //Call the superclass (Vehicle) constructor to construct the Vehicle
        // component of the Bike. We will pass in the top speed, make, and
        // number of wheels (which we know will be 2)</em>
        super(makeIn,topSpeedIn,2);

        <em>// Set up the Bike-specific properties</em>
        this.isOffRoad = offRoadIn;
        this.nGears = nGearsIn;
    }

    display()
    {
        super.display();
        alert(`Off road? ${this.isOffRoad} No. Gears: ${this.nGears}`);
    }
}
</pre>
