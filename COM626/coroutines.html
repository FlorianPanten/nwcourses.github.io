<h1>More on Coroutines</h1>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We have already looked at coroutines briefly in the context of Android.
These notes will extend upon that and look at some additional features of
coroutines.</p>
<p>To revise: Kotlin allows you to achieve the same effect as threads with
<em>coroutines</em>. 
A coroutine is a function that can run in either the foreground
or the background, can switch between foreground and background without having to write asynchronous code, and can be <em>suspended</em> (paused) to allow
another operation to take place.</p>
</ul>
<p>We also saw that coroutines must be <em>launched</em> from a <em>scope</em>. The scope represents what the coroutine is launched from, e.g. a console-mode program or an <code>Activity</code>. The coroutine has a lifetime equal to the lifetime of its scope. For example a coroutine launched from the Android <code>lifecycleScope</code> means the coroutine has the scope of the parent component (e.g. activity or fragment) and will stop when the parent is destroyed.</p>
<h2>Coroutines using basic command-line Kotlin</h2>
<p>For this topic we will use command-line Kotlin. You can use the
<em><a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/'>IntelliJ IDEA</a></em> IDE to try out these examples, but if you do, you will need to add the coroutines library as a dependency to <code>build.gradle</code> (choose a Gradle project) because it's separate to the Kotlin standard library.
<pre>implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.4")</pre>
 If you have access to
a machine with the command-line, you can also 
<a href='https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html'>install Kotlin standalone</a>.</p> 
<p>There are some exercises here. As well as doing the exercises,
<strong>try out the examples</strong> to get a feel of what is going on.</p>
<h3>Basic example</h3>
<p>Here is an example of a basic Kotlin program which launches a coroutine.
The coroutine is launched from the <strong>global scope</strong>, which 
is the scope of the running program.
<pre>
fun main() {
    GlobalScope.launch {
        for(i in 0..100) {
            println(i)
        }
    }
    println("Not in the coroutine")
}
</pre>
This code is launching a coroutine which counts to 100.
The code inside <code>launch</code> will run in the background, so
<em>Not in the coroutine</em> will appear before the <code>launch</code> block
has finished. But actually in this example, the <code>main()</code> function does not wait for the coroutine to finish, so you never see the output of the for
loop. This is because <strong>a coroutine launched from a given scope will
terminate when its parent scope terminates.</strong> Here, the parent
scope is the <code>GlobalScope</code> - the scope of the program - and thus
will terminate when the program terminates.</p>
<p>If you add
<pre>Thread.sleep(1000)</pre>
after the "Not in the coroutine" println, then the GlobalScope 
will pause 1000 milliseconds and will allow the coroutine to finish.</p>

<h3>Using join() to wait for a coroutine to finish</h3>

<p>The other approach to the above would be to tell the GlobalScope to <em>wait</em> for the coroutine to finish. We could use <code>join()</code> 
for this. 
For example, would this code work?
<pre>
fun main() {
    val coroutine = GlobalScope.launch {
        for(i in 0..100) {
            println(i)
        }
    }
    println("Not in the coroutine")
    coroutine.join()
}
</pre>
Even though it looks sensible, this will not work, you will get a compiler 
error informing you that <code>join()</code> can only be called in another coroutine. The problem is, our <code>main()</code> is not a coroutine; it is just a
regular function. However, You can turn <code>main()</code> into a coroutine by 
assigning it to the result of a <code>runBlocking</code> call.
<code>runBlocking</code> launches a coroutine and "blocks the current thread until all tasks inside that coroutine are finished" (<a href='https://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-coroutines/'>Leiva</a>).
Here, this means that the main thread
blocks (cannot do any other tasks) until the coroutine launched with
<code>runBlocking</code> has finished. This will mean the program will only complete when the <code>runBlocking</code> coroutine has finished.
<strong>It's important to note that <code>runBlocking()</code>
will create a new scope, separate from the global scope.</strong>
<pre>
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val coroutine = GlobalScope.launch {
        for(i in 0..100) {
            println(i)
        }
    }
    println("Not in the coroutine")
    coroutine.join()
}
</pre>
This will work as expected, i.e the <code>join()</code> call will wait for the inner coroutine to complete before finishing. We can legally call <code>join()</code> here, as it's being called inside a coroutine (the one launched with <code>runBlocking</code>).
</p>
<p>
So we will see:
<pre>
Not in the coroutine
0
1
...
100
</pre>
as the output.</p>
<h3>Delaying a coroutine</h3>
<p>Within a coroutine, we call tell it to delay by a certain number of milliseconds. 
<pre>
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val coroutine = GlobalScope.launch {
        delay(1000) // delay the start of the counter for one second
        for(i in 0..100) {
            delay(100) // delay for 100ms each time the loop runs
            println(i)
        }
    }
    println("Not in the coroutine")
    coroutine.join()
}
</pre>
This will delay execution in the coroutine by 100 milliseconds each iteration of the loop. <code>delay()</code> is non-blocking, ie. the delay in the coroutine 
will not delay other strands of execution; for example, here, the coroutine
launched with <code>GlobalScope.launch</code> will block, but the <code>main()</code> coroutine will not.</p>
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<ol>
<li>Try out the above example. Before running it, ask yourself: when will
"Not in the coroutine" appear? Run the program and see if you get the
answer you expect.</li>
<li>Launch two separate coroutines from your <code>main()</code> coroutine. One 
should count
from 0 to 50 in steps of 2 (add <code>step 2</code> to your for loop), pausing
for 100 milliseconds each time. The other should count from 100 to 1000 in steps
of 100 (add <code>step 100</code> to your for loop), pausing for one second each time. Write a "finished" message in your <code>main()</code> coroutine when
<em>both</em> coroutines have finished.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Suspend functions</h3>

Critical to coroutines is the concept of <em>suspending functions</em>. These 
are marked with <code>suspend</code> and allow code to be suspended within them.
withContext() works because it is a suspending function itself.

What if we wanted to do the loop coroutine (with delay, as in the previous
example) from a <em>function</em> from a coroutine? Would this work?
<pre>
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val coroutine = GlobalScope.launch {
       doLoop()
    }
    println("Not in the coroutine")
    coroutine.join()
}

fun doLoop() {
     for(i in 0..100) {
        delay(100)
        println(i)
     }
}
</pre>
This would cause a compilation error, because <code>delay()</code> can only be called within a coroutine.Even though <code>doLoop()</code> is called from 
within the coroutine launched with <code>GlobalScope.launch()</code>,
it will not work as <code>doLoop</code> has to be declared as a 
 <strong>suspend</strong> function</em>.
A suspend function is a function which is capable of suspending
a coroutine, as delay() does here. So we need to rewrite our code as follows:
<pre>
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val coroutine = GlobalScope.launch {
       doLoop()
    }
    println("Not in the coroutine")
    coroutine.join()
}

<strong>suspend</strong> fun doLoop() {
     for(i in 0..100) {
            delay(100)
            println(i)
     }
}
</pre>


<h3>Coroutines terminate when the scope used to launch them terminates</h3>

<p>Consider this example:
<pre>
fun main() = runBlocking{
    GlobalScope.launch {
        for(i in 0..10) {  
            delay(100)
            println(i)
        }
    }
    println("Not in the coroutine")
}
</pre>
As we have seen, this example will <em>not</em> wait for the loop to finish, as we did not use <code>join()</code>.  But what does the 
<strong>GlobalScope</strong> actually mean? It is the
<em>global scope</em>, i.e. the scope of the running program. As we have seen, <strong>a coroutine launched in a given scope will be terminated when its parent scope (here the running program) is terminated.</strong> So when the program finishes, the coroutine will terminate even if the loop hasn't finished iterating yet.</p>
<p>Can we deal with this without using join()? Yes - 
in fact we can - we can launch the coroutine using plain 
<code>launch</code>, not <code>GlobalScope.launch</code>. 
This is because, if the scope is not specified, the given coroutine 
will be launched in <em>the scope of its parent coroutine</em>. As the parent
coroutine is the main() coroutine launched with <code>runBlocking</code>, it
will mean that the child coroutine (the one which does the loop) will
also execute in the <code>runBlocking</code> scope. 
So it won't finish until the <code>main()</code> coroutine has finished.So if we 
do :
<pre>
fun main() = runBlocking{
    launch {
        for(i in 0..10) {  
            delay(100)
            println(i)
        }
    }
    println("Not in the coroutine")
}
</pre>
the <code>runBlocking</code> scope will wait for the coroutine to finish before 
finishing itself because the coroutine is now running in the scope of runBlocking rather than the program scope.</p>

<p>launch() is a method of CoroutineScope therefore it must be called within a coroutineScope or be called from GlobalScope.launch.  It takes a block of code to run - a function which will be run as the coroutine.</p>
<h4>Making <code>main()</code> a suspend function</h4>
<p>As an alternative you can make <code>main()</code> a suspend function, which allows you to launch coroutines in the <code>GlobalScope</code> (but unlike <code>runBlocking()</code>, does not give you a separate scope):
<pre>
suspend fun main() {
    GlobalScope.launch {
        // ...
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Jobs</h3>

<p>What is actually returned when we launch a coroutine with <code>launch()</code>?  We are returned a <strong>Job</strong> object. This can be used to control the 
coroutine, for example, cancel it. The join() method you've seen already is a 
method of Job; this will cause the outer coroutine (the one launched with <code>runBlocking()</code> to wait until the child coroutine that the job refers to has finished.

<h3>Concurrent coroutines</h3>
<p>One of the key things that coroutines allow is <em>concurrency</em>. We can launch several coroutines in parallel by launching multiple jobs. The code below shows this and also shows the use of <code>joinAll()</code> to wait for all coroutines in a list to complete. Note how we write a function <code>launchJob()</code> to launch a coroutine from a given scope.
<pre>
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    val jobs = listOf(
        launchJob(GlobalScope, 0, 10, 1, 1000L),
        launchJob(GlobalScope, 0, 20, 2, 4000L)
    )
    jobs.joinAll()
    println("All jobs finished")

}

fun launchJob(scope: CoroutineScope, start: Int, end: Int, step: Int, delay: Long): Job {
    return scope.launch {
        for (i in start..end step step) {
            // Use formatted text, %d means whole number (int or long), %4d means use a field 4 characters wide
            println("Counting from %4d to %4d, step %2d, delay %4d ------- %d".format(start, end, step, delay, i))
            delay(delay)
        }
        println("Counting from %4d to %4d, step %2d, delay %4d ------- COMPLETED!").format(start, end, step, delay))

    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Exercise - Jobs</h3>
<ol>
<li>Take this code:
<pre>
fun main() = runBlocking{
    launch {
        for(i in 0..10) {  
            delay(1000)
            println(i)
        }
    }
    println("Not in the coroutine")
}
</pre>
Modify the example so that the <em>main coroutine</em> waits for 5 seconds
after launching the loop coroutine, and then cancels the loop
coroutine. Job has a <code>cancel()</code> method. Does it still count to 10?</li>
<li>Modify the concurrency example to add a third job which counts from 0 to 5 in steps of 1 with a 10-second delay.</li>
<li>Launch each job from the <code>runBlocking</code> coroutine's own scope, rather than the <code>GlobalScope</code>. (<em>Hint</em>: <code>runBlocking</code> takes a lambda function, with the scope as its single parameter). If you do this, can you remove anything from the code?</li>
