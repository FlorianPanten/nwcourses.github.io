</a-box>

<!--
    Via an animation, make the box rotate to 360 degrees about the z-axis over a time scale of 5 seconds. (This is how you make something rotate a full circle; start at 0 and finish at 360).

    Change the animation so it continuously rotates in a loop.

    Change the animation so that it rotates from 0 to 180, then 180 back to 0, then 0 to 180, then 180 to 0, and so on - continuously in a loop.

    Add a second animation which changes the colour from #ff0000 to #00ff00 but over a period of 10 seconds.

    Add your 'cross' compound entity from the previous scene into this scene. Make it animate from y=0 to y=5, back to y=0, back to y=5, back to y=0 and so on (so it continuously 'takes off' and 'lands') over a time period of 5 seconds.
