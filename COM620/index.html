<p>These are the full notes for the <em>Immersive Technologies</em> module.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Virtual reality (computer generated worlds using 3D graphics) and augmented reality (the augmentation of the real world, as seen through a device's camera feed, with computer generated content) are amongst the most exciting new developments in computing these days. From  3D virtual worlds to AR games such as Pokemon Go, they offer many new and exciting possibilities. 

Furthermore, development of VR and AR applications is increasingly possible using the web, using no more than HTML and JavaScript. This module will focus on the development of web based VR and AR mobile applications, capable of running on multiple platforms, including Android and iOS. The module will be JavaScript based and will make use of popular and emerging, cutting-edge technologies for web VR and AR such as A-Frame, three.js, and AR.js.
