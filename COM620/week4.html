<h1>Week 4: AJAX, JSON, Web APIs and A-Frame</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week we will:
<ul>
<li>Finish the work on the <code>vertical-controls</code> component that we
looked at last week.</li>
<li>Revise and update our knowledge on AJAX</li>
<li>Look at how we can dynamically <em>create</em> components in A-Frame</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vertically controlling the camera</h2>
<p>Before we begin the new material today, we will finish the last section
from <a href='week3.html#controllingthecamera'>last time</a>.</p>
<h2>AJAX revision</h2>
<p>Last year on DFTI we looked at <em>AJAX</em> and saw that it was 
approach to developing highly interactive web applications which communicate
with the server <strong>in the background, without the page being reloaded.</strong> So, with AJAX we can create interactive, instant searches (such as that seen on Google) for example. Your JavaScript code sends a request, and the server sends data back, typically in a pure-data format such as <em>JSON</em>
(see <a href='../wad/wad1.html'>here</a> for more information about JSON). 
The JSON is then <em>parsed</em>
and the page dynamically updated with the new data.</p>
<p>For example, we could have an AJAX application to search for all products of a given type (e.g cornflakes). Our JavaScript could send a product type, such as "Cornflakes", to a PHP script running on a server, and the PHP could send back JSON containing all the cornflakes manufactured by different manufacturers. Then, the second JavaScript function (the AJAX <em>callback</em>), could parse the JSON and update the HTML front-end with the search results (all cornflakes products).</p>
<p>You can find some AJAX 
refresher notes <a href='../wad/ajax.html'>on WAD</a>, including how to parse 
JSON.</p>
<h2>New style AJAX requests with the fetch API</h2>
<p>Last year, we looked at an older approach to AJAX (the XMLHttpRequest 
API). However, this has now been superseded by another
API - the fetch API. Here is an example of the use of the fetch API;
<pre>
function ajaxSearch(productType) {
    fetch(`https://server/api.php?productType=${productType}`)
        .then(response =&gt; response.text())
        .then(text =&gt; {
            document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
        });
}

// Make the AJAX run when we click a button
document.getElementById('ajaxButton').addEventListener('click', ()=&gt; {
    // Read the product type from a text field
    const product = document.getElementById('productType').value;
    ajaxSearch(product);
});
</pre>
How is this working?
<ul>
<li>We fetch a response from the given URL. Here we are contacting a 
server-side script which searches for all products of a given type.</li>
<li><em>then</em>, when we get the response, we obtain the text from it.</li>
<li><em>then</em>, when we have the raw text of the response, we run an 
arrow function to place the results inside a &lt;div&gt;. This arrow
function is passed the raw text of the response as a parameter.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Promises</h3>
<p>We'll now look in a bit more detail at what is going on with our fetch API
request, and in particular look at the concept of a <em>promise</em>. The
<code>fetch</code> call, above, returns a <em>Promise</em> object.
A promise is an object which "promises" to do a particular (typically)
asynchronous, background task which will complete at some point in the future,
such as an AJAX request. The <code>fetch()</code> function will return 
immediately, but will not do the AJAX request immediately. Instead, it returns
a <em>promise object</em> which will, at some point in the future, be either
<em>fulfilled</em> or <em>rejected</em>. These outcomes are as follows;
    <ul>
    <li>A promise is <em>fulfilled</em> or <em>resolved</em> as soon as the 
    background task completes successfully, for example when a response is
    received from an AJAX call;</li>
    <li>or it is <em>rejected</em> if it fails with an error, for example
    there is a network timeout on an AJAX call.</li>
    </ul>
We handle each of those two outcomes using the <code>then()</code> and
<code>catch()</code> functions. The function supplied as an argument to
<code>then</code> (the <strong>resolve</strong> function)
will run <strong>as soon as the promise is fulfilled</strong>
while the function supplied as an argument to <code>catch</code> will run 
<strong>as soon as the promise is rejected</strong>.
</p>
<p>
So, promises allow you to write code with intuitive, clean syntax in
this form:
<pre>promise.then(resolveFunction).catch(rejectFunction);</pre>
where "promise" is the promise object, and <code>resolveFunction</code> and
<code>rejectFunction</code> are the functions which run on fulfilment and
rejection, respectively.</p>
<p>Note that this topic does not include how to write your own promises from
scratch, only how to use promises returned from APIs written by others, for
example the fetch API. You can read about how to create your own promises in
the <a href='../wad/promises.html'>WAD notes on promises</a>.</p> 
<h4>Relating promises to the fetch API</h4>
<p>So, returning to our fetch API example, what is happening with this code in
terms of promises? (Note, I have now added a <code>catch()</code>).
<pre>
fetch(`https://server/api.php?productType=${productType}`)
    .then(response =&gt; response.text())
    .then(text =&gt; {
        document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
    })
    .catch(e =&gt; { alert(`An error occurred: ${e}`); } );
</pre>
<ul>
<li>We make our <code>fetch()</code> request. This returns a promise, which
will resolve when we get a response back from the server.</li>
<li>We supply the arrow function <code>response =&gt; response.text()</code>
as the resolve function. This takes the response and obtains text from it.
Note that this is shorthand for:
<code>.then(response =&gt; { return response.text(); } );</code>
in other words, if an arrow function only returns a value and does not do
anything else, we can omit the curly brackets and the <code>return</code>.
</li>
<li>Note that <code>response.text()</code> does not return the text directly. Perhaps surprisingly, <code>response.text()</code> <strong>itself returns a promise</strong>, which will fulfil as soon as text is obtained from the response so we need <strong>yet another then()</strong> with a <strong>second resolve function</strong> passed as an argument, i.e:
<pre>
.then(text =&gt; {
    document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
});
</pre>
This second resolve function gets passed the text as a parameter, and
simply places this text inside a &lt;div&gt;.</li>
<li>Finally, any errors that might occur during the whole process are handled
with the <code>catch()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>async/await</h3>
<p>ECMAScript 8 (aka ECMAScript 2017) introduces <em>async/await</em>.
This allows you to write promise-based,
asynchronous code in a sequential manner. Here is how we would rewrite our
<em>fetch</em> API code using async/await:
<pre>
<em>async</em> function ajaxSearch(productType) {
    const response = <em>await</em> fetch(`https://server/api.php?productType=${productType}`);
    const text = <em>await</em> resonse.text();
    document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
}

// Make the AJAX run when we click a button
document.getElementById('ajaxButton').addEventListener('click', ()=&gt; {
    // Read the product type from a text field
    const product = document.getElementById('productType').value;
    ajaxSearch(product);
});
</pre>
Note how we're doing a whole AJAX / JSON parsing procedure using sequential
code, even though AJAX is an asynchronous process. The key things are:
    <ul>
    <li>The function <em>ajaxSearch()</em> is declared as <em>async</em>, 
    which makes it a special kind of function (an <em>AsyncFunction</em>)
    allowing us to do async/await;</li>
    <li><em>fetch()</em> (which if you remember returns a promise to do an
    AJAX call) is preceded by <em>await</em>. What <em>await()</em> does is
    suspend execution of the rest of the <em>async</em> function until the
    promise concerned has been fulfilled. 
    The argument to the resolve function of
    the promise is then <em>returned</em> from the <em>await</em> call.
    </li>
    </ul>
Note also that <em>await</em> will only work with a promise. It's
<em>awaiting the successful resolution of that promise</em>. Trying to use
<em>await</em> without a Promise will not work!</li>
</p>
<p>To make the code more robust we need to handle errors. Here is how to
do this with <em>async/await</em>:
<pre>
<em>async</em> function ajaxSearch(productType) {
    try {
        const response = <em>await</em> fetch(`https://server/api.php?productType=${productType}`);
        const text = <em>await</em> resonse.text();
        document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
    } catch(e) {
        alert(`Error: ${e}`);
    }
}

// Make the AJAX run when we click a button
document.getElementById('ajaxButton').addEventListener('click', ()=&gt; {
    // Read the product type from a text field
    const product = document.getElementById('productType').value;
    ajaxSearch(product);
});
</pre>
Note how we <em>try</em> to do the promise based, asynchronous code and
<em>catch</em> any promise rejections in the <em>catch</em> block. The catch
block gets passed the error message accompanying the promise rejection.</p>
<h4>async/await with JSON</h4>
<p>The previous examples have shown <em>fetch()</em> AJAX requests which return
plain text. Here is a version which communicates with a server which returns
JSON instead:
<pre>
<em>async</em> function ajaxSearch(productType) {
    // Send a request to our remote URL
       const response = <em>await</em> fetch(`https://server/api.php?productType=${productType}`);

    // Parse the JSON.
    const products = <em>await</em> response.json();

    // Loop through the array of JSON objects and add the results to a &lt;div&gt;
    let html = "";
    products.forEach ( product =&gt; {
        html += `Product Name: ${product.name} Manufacturer: ${product.manufacturer} Price: ${product.price}&lt;br /&gt;`;
    });
    document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = html;
}

// Make the AJAX run when we click a button
document.getElementById('ajaxButton').addEventListener('click', ()=&gt; {
    // Read the product type from a text field
    const product = document.getElementById('productType').value;
    ajaxSearch(product);
});
</pre>
This code is very similar to the text-based example. The main difference is
we use <code>response.json()</code> rather than <code>response.text()</code>.
This returns a promise which resolves when the JSON in the response has
been parsed (compare <code>response.text()</code>, which returns a promise
which resolves when we have extracted text from the response).</p>
<p>The other diference is that we need to loop through our array of JSON
objects returned from the server. The JSON might look like this:
<pre>
[
    {
        "name":"Cornflakes",
        "manufacturer":"Organic Products Ltd.",
        "price": 2.49 
    },
    {
        "name":"Cornflakes",
        "manufacturer":"Cockadoodle Cereal Co.",
        "price": 1.79 
    },
    {
        "name":"Cornflakes",
        "manufacturer":"Smith Emporium",
        "price": 0.79 
    },
]
</pre>
so hopefully you can see how we loop through each product object within the JSON
and extract the name, manufacturer and price fields from it. Notice also how
<code>forEach()</code> allows us to loop through each member of an array
without needing a <code>for</code> loop with an index. 
<code>forEach()</code> is a function which performs a second function on each member of an array. Each member of the array in turn is passed into this second function as a parameter.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Creation of Components with A-Frame</h2>
<p>We are now going to look at how we can <em>dynamically create entities and
components using A-Frame</em> and the DOM. So far, our entities and components 
have been hard-coded in HTML. However in many cases, we might want to 
dynamically build a scene based on data sent back, in JSON for example, from
the web. Most augmented reality apps would work this way: the augmented 
content would not be hard-coded but downloaded from a server. For example,
points of interest in an AR or VR POI app would be downloaded from a server
and in Pokemon Go the locations of the Pokemon are also downloaded. So we
need to know how to dynamically generate content in A-Frame.</p>
<p>In the DOM notes we looked at <code>document.createElement</code> So,
we can use <code>document.createElement()</code> here to dynamically create
our A-Frame content. Here is an example:
<pre>
AFRAME.registerComponent('dynamic-content-loader', {
    init: function() {
        // Create an entity with document.createElement()
        const entity = document.createElement('a-entity');

        // Add a geometry component to it (a box primitive)
        entity.setAttribute('geometry', {
            primitive: 'box'
        });

        // Add a material component to it (red colour)
        entity.setAttribute('material', {
            color: 'red'
        });

        // Set its position within the 3D world
        entity.setAttribute('position', {
            x: 0,
            y: 1,
            z: -5
        });

        // Append the entity to the scene (this.el.sceneEl)
        this.el.sceneEl.appendChild(entity);
    }
});
</pre>
which would be used along with an A-Frame scene such as that below:
<pre>
&lt;a-scene&gt;
&lt;a-sky color="skyblue"&lt;&lt;/a-sky&gt;
&lt;a-plane color='green' position='0 0 0' rotation='-90 0 0'&gt;&lt;/a-plane&gt;
&lt;a-entity dynamic-content-loader&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;
&lt;/a-scene&gt;
</pre>
What is this doing?
    <ul>
    <li>We are definining a component called <code>dynamic-content-loader</code>.
    This component is attached to a generic &lt;a-entity&gt; in our scene.
    </li>
    <li>Within this component we create an <code>a-entity</code> dynamically using DOM, and set its <code>geometry</code>, <code>material</code> and <code>position</code> components.</li>
    <li>Then we <em>append</em> the entity we've just created to the A-Frame <em>scene</em>. Note how we can access the A-Frame scene from any entity using <code>this.el.sceneEl</code>. Whereas <code>this.el</code> represents the current entity, <code>this.el.sceneEl</code> represents the scene as a whole. So the entity we've dynamically created will be a child of our <em>scene</em>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>This example is just a simple example of creating dynamic content, but
you could use a component like this to load JSON over AJAX and then create
content based on parsing the JSON.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>The exercise is to bring this all together and dynamically create a scene
by contacting a web API to retrieve JSON. At the URL
<pre>https://www.free-map.org.uk/course/imm/world.php</pre>
is a server-side application which returns JSON of various points of interest
(restaurants, cafes etc). If no 'type' parameter is supplied, <strong>all</strong> points of interest are returned, while if there is a type, e.g:
<pre>https://www.free-map.org.uk/course/imm/world.php?type=cafe</pre>
only points of interest of that type are returned.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If you want practice on basic AJAX</strong>, 
first build a simple, HTML-based
application (no A-Frame) which searches for all points of interest of a given
type by sending an AJAX request to this URL, parsing the
JSON returned, and listing the points of interest in a &lt;div&gt;. See
the JSON async/await example above and modify this. Your HTML page should
have a text field allowing the user to enter the type, and a button
which calls your AJAX function when it is clicked.
</li>
<li>Build an A-Frame application which contacts this
URL, downloads the data (<strong>all</strong> points of interest)
from it (using fetch), parses the JSON, and uses the
data contained in the JSON to create A-Frame spheres for each point of 
interest at their coordinates.</li>
<li>Add code so that an alert box with the name of the point of interest
appears when you click on it. You should be able to work out how to do this from the mouse events section from last week.</li>
<li>Change your code to colour the spheres differently depending on point
of interest type. Cafes should be in brown, restaurants in blue and bars
in red.</li>
</ol>
