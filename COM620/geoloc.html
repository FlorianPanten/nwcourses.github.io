<h1>Geolocation</h1>
<h2>Latitude and Longitude</h2>
<p>In order to understand location-based applications, it is important
to understand the coordinate system used on the earth. The most common
coordinate system uses <em>latitude and longitude</em>. Latitude is a measure
of how far north or south you are: the equator is at 0 degrees,
while the North Pole is at 90 degrees North, we are at about 50 and Spain
is at about 40. Longitude is a measure of how far east or west you are:
0 degrees of longitude is referred to as the <em>Prime Meridian</em>
(or <em>Greenwich Meridian</em>) and passes through Greenwich, London. 
By contrast Germany is located
between approximately 7 degrees and 15 degrees East, while New York is at
74 degrees West and the west coast of North America at approximately 120
degrees West.</p>
<p><img src="../images/latlon.png" alt="Latitude and longitude" /></p>
<p>So a given point on the earth can be defined via its latitude and
longitude. We are at, approximately, 50.9 North (latitude) and 1.4 West
(longitude). By convention, latitudes north of the equator and longitudes
east of Greenwich are treated as positive, so we can also define our
position as <strong>longitude -1.4, latitude +50.9</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Geolocation API</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Geolocation API allows you to obtain the current location of the
device running the browser from within JavaScript. Even on desktop browsers
this will give a result if you are using a wireless network, but its real
use is in the mobile web development world. A mobile browser can talk to the
GPS chip of the phone and obtain the phone's current location on the earth.
Alternatively, if the GPS chip is not available, a rough estimate can be
obtained from cell towers or wireless networks.</p>
<h4>Using the Geolocation API</h4>
<p>It is fairly straightforward to use the Geolocation API. Here is an 
example (<strong>please note - all examples in this topic will show the JavaScript only, not the HTML</strong>):
<pre>
if(navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition (
            gpspos=&gt; {
                console.log(`Lat ${gpspos.coords.latitude} Lon ${gpspos.coords.longitude}`); // show on the console
            },

            err=&gt; {
                alert(`An error occurred: ${err.code}`);
            }

        );
    } else {
        alert("Sorry, geolocation not supported in this browser");
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>How is this working?
    <ul>
    <li>The code
    tests whether geolocation is possible in our browser by checking for the
    existence of the <em>navigator.geolocation</em> variable. If it doesn't
    exist, we display an error. If it <em>does</em> exist, we tell the
    geolocation object to obtain the current position with 
    <em>getCurrentPosition()</em>. This takes two arguments, both functions:
        <ul>
        <li>The first argument (an arrow function here)
        is the function that will run as soon as we get a 
        location back from the GPS chip (or wireless network, etc)</li>
        <li>The second (here, another arrow function) will run if there
        was an error obtaining the location.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Note the <em>asynchronous</em> approach here, just like AJAX. It might
    take time to obtain a position, so we set up a <em>callback</em>
    function to run once we have obtained the position, and continue
    processing in the meantime. So any statements below the 
    <em>getCurrentPosition()</em> might run before 
    the callback <em>processPosition()</em> starts running.
    </li>
    <li>Considering each of these two functions in turn, let's look at
    <em>processPosition()</em> first. This is automatically supplied with
    one parameter, <em>gpspos</em>, which is an object 
    representing the position returned from the GPS device or other location provider. This object has a property <em>coords</em> representing the
    coordinates, and <em>coords</em> itself has two properties,
    <em>latitude</em> and <em>longitude</em>.
    Therefore, we can obtain the latitude and
    longitude with <em>gpspos.coords.latitude</em> and 
    <em>gpspos.coords.longitude</em>. So what this example is doing is
    displaying the coordinates in the console (you can view the console
    via More Tools-Developer Tools in Chrome or Web Developer-Web Console
    in Firefox).</li>
    <li>Moving onto <em>handleError()</em> which is the function which
    is run if there is any sort of error in obtaining the position: again, 
    this is automatically supplied with one parameter, <em>err</em>,
    an object representing the exact error which occurred. The most meaningful
    property of <em>err</em> is a numerical code, <em>err.code</em>, which
    is what we are displaying here. There are several codes
    (ref <a href='http://www.diveintohtml5.info/geolocation.html'>Dive into 
    HTML5</a>, Mark Pilgrim):
        <ul>
        <li>1 means that the user denied the browser access to the device's
        location. For security reasons, a user has to agree to the browser
        accessing the device's GPS chip, and if they deny that access, the
        error function will run with a code of 1.</li>
        <li>2 means that the location could not be obtained, e.g the
        GPS satellites or wireless networks are unavailable;</li>
        <li>3 means a timeout, i.e. the GPS satellites or network are 
        available but it has taken too long to contact them.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Watching the position</h3>
<p>The above code will simply obtain the current position and stop. In a
typical mobile GPS application, however, the user will want to be informed
of their location on a regular basis. To do this we use 
<em>watchPosition()</em> in place of <em>getCurrentPosition()</em>. Here is
an example:
<pre>
if(navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.watchPosition (

        gpspos=&gt; {
            console.log(`Lat ${gpspos.coords.latitude} Lon ${gpspos.coords.longitude}`); // show on the console
        },

        err=&gt; {
            alert(`An error occurred: ${err.code}`);
        },

        {
            enableHighAccuracy:true, 
            maximumAge: 5000 
        }

    );
} else {
    alert("Sorry, geolocation not supported in this browser");
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note that the code is almost the same as the first example, except:
    <ul>
    <li>We use <em>watchPosition()</em> rather than 
    <em>getCurrentPosition()</em>. The result will be that the GPS chip 
    (or other location provider) will communicate the current location back
    to the process position arrow 
    function every time the location changes, rather 
    than just the once.</li>
    <li>Note also the additional options passed as a third parameter to
    <em>watchPosition()</em>. On many mobile devices, if we want to use the
    GPS chip (rather than cell towers, wireless networks, etc) we have
    to set the <em>enableHighAccuracy</em> option to <em>true</em>. Also
    if we want to force the GPS to return a reading every so-many seconds,
    we have to specify a value for the <em>maximumAge</em> option, in 
    milliseconds. So the above example will refresh at least every 5 
    seconds.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>IMPORTANT - Geolocation API now needs HTTPS server</h3>
<p>For security reasons (the risk of your location being intercepted by
packet-sniffers) the Geolocation API now
requires the use of an HTTPS server (a web server with
encrypted communication), on both Chrome and Firefox. 
If you are running on <code>localhost</code> (your own local machine),
however, HTTPS is not needed.</p>
<p>See <a href='https://letsencrypt.org'>Let's Encrypt</a> for information on
setting up an HTTPS server.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<ol>
<li>Write a simple application that displays your current latitude and
longitude inside a &lt;div&gt;. Note that if you are on a wifi network this
might be inaccurate; for example at home I am located at Stoke-on-Trent,
a long way from where I live!</li>
<li>At this URL:
<pre>https://hikar.org/fm/ws/bsvr.php?bbox=WEST,SOUTH,EAST,NORTH&amp;poi=all&amp;format=json</pre>
is a JSON web service which returns nearby points of interest.
(WEST, SOUTH, EAST and NORTH represent the edges of a box to search in).
Write an application which creates a box where;
<ul>
<li>WEST=your current longitude-0.05</li>
<li>SOUTH=your current latitude-0.05</li>
<li>EAST=your current longitude+0.05</li>
<li>NORTH=your current latitude+0.05</li>
</ul>
and sends an AJAX request to the above URL. Parse the JSON returned and show
the contents of the <em>properties</em> of each feature in the
 JSON within a &lt;div&gt;.</li>
</ol>
