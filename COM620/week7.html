<h1>Topic 7: Geographical Data and 3D Applications</h1>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week we will:
<ul>
<li>Revise geographic concepts first met in COM518</li>
<li>Look at the Geolocation API</li>
<li>Look at GeoJSON</li>
</ul>
<h2>AJAX revision</h2>
<p>Last year in COM518 (see <a href='https://nwcourses.github.io/COM518/topic5.html'>here</a>) we looked at <em>AJAX</em> and saw that it was an approach to developing highly interactive web applications which communicate with the server <strong>in the background, without the page being reloaded.</strong> So, with AJAX we can create interactive, instant searches (such as that seen on Google) for example. Your JavaScript code sends a request, and the server sends data back, typically in a pure-data format such as <em>JSON</em> (see <a href='https://nwcourses.github.io/COM518/topic3.html'>here</a> for more information about JSON).  The JSON is then <em>parsed</em> and the page dynamically updated with the new data.</p>
<p>This week we are going to look at AJAX and JSON in combination with A-Frame or three.js. Your A-Frame or three.js application will connect to a web API via AJAX. The web API will send back a specific form of JSON (called <em>GeoJSON</em>) which we will examine later. We can then dynamically create A-Frame entities or three.js meshes using the data contained within the GeoJSON.</p>
<h2>Revision - Latitude and Longitude</h2>
<p><em>Please note; this was first covered in COM518 last year.</em></p>
<p>In order to understand location-based applications, it is important
to understand the coordinate system used on the earth. The most common
coordinate system uses <em>latitude and longitude</em>. Latitude is a measure
of how far north or south you are: the equator is at 0 degrees,
while the North Pole is at 90 degrees North, we are at about 50 and Spain
is at about 40. Longitude is a measure of how far east or west you are:
0 degrees of longitude is referred to as the <em>Prime Meridian</em>
(or <em>Greenwich Meridian</em>) and passes through Greenwich, London. 
By contrast Germany is located between approximately 7 degrees and 15 degrees East, while New York is at 74 degrees West and the west coast of North America at approximately 120 degrees West.</p>
<p><img src="../images/latlon.png" alt="Latitude and longitude" /></p>
<p>So a given point on the earth can be defined via its latitude and
longitude. We are at, approximately, 50.9 North (latitude) and 1.4 West
(longitude). By convention, latitudes north of the equator and longitudes
east of Greenwich are treated as positive, so we can also define our
position as <strong>longitude -1.4, latitude +50.9</strong>.</p>
<h2>Projections</h2>
<p>An important consideration when doing web mapping is that
<em>the earth is not flat</em> (it's more or less a sphere) while
<em>maps are flat</em>. To display a curved surface on a flat piece
of paper, or a 3D world via three.js or A-Frame, we need to do a <em>projection</em> and mathematically transform the latitude and longitude to coordinates suitable for representation on a flat surface. Why is this?
Imagine any printed map of the earth. The map is equal width everywhere, from
far northern areas such as Greenland or north Norway, to the equator. This does not match reality; since the earth is (more or less) a sphere, the circumference of the earth will be much greater at the equator than those far northern
areas - indeed, at the poles, the circumference of the earth is zero!</p>
<p>For this reason, latitude and longitude must be transformed
to so called <em>projected coordinates</em> if we want to represent them on
a flat surface, such as the ground of a 3D world. 
The details of exactly how this projection is done is 
out of scope of this module, as we will be using a library.</p> 
<p>The most common projection used with web mapping is 
referred to as <em>Web Mercator</em> (a type of <em>Spherical Mercator</em>). This is sometimes informally known as the "Google Projection" because Google popularised it with Google Maps.
</p>
<p><img src="../images/projection_new.png" 
alt="Projecting sphere onto flat surface" /></p>
<h3>Web Mercator and OpenGL</h3>
<p>When developing a 3D OpenGL application, using three.js or A-Frame, we need to use projected coordinates, not latitude and longitude. One unit (<em>degree</em>) of longitude is not equal in distance to one degree of latitude, and furthermore, as can be seen from the diagram of the Earth above, one degree of longitude covers a different distance depending on where you are on the earth. At the poles, one degree of longitude has a distance of zero, as all the lines of longitude meet there. As you move towards the equator, the circumference of the earth at that latitude increases, to reach a maximum at the equator. So at the equator, one degree of longitude occupies a greater distance than at any other location.</p>
<p>By contrast, Web Mercator units approximate to metres, at least away from far north or far south latitudes. So we can use Web Mercator units, together with elevation above sea level in metres, as 3D coordinates in a 3D world in three.js or A-Frame. Web Mercator coordinates contain two components: <em>easting</em> (a measure of how far east you are, equivalent to longitude) and <em>northing</em> (a measure of how far north you are, equivalent to latitude).</p>
<p>There is a common convention for relating OpenGL world coordinates to Web Mercator eastings and northings, which is to map eastings to the x axis, northings to the z axis and elevation above sea level to the y axis. This is shown on the diagram below.
<br />
<img src='../images/mercator.png' alt='Relating OpenGL world coordinates to Web Mercator coordinates' />
<br />
It can be seen that the OpenGL coordinate system maps nicely onto the Web Mercator system using this convention. However there is one problem. <em>Web Mercator northings increase as we go north, and decrease as we go south, with the equator at northing 0. However, with the OpenGL coordinate system, if we assume +x is east and -x west, then -z will be north and +z will be south, according to the diagram above. So the sign of the z axis is the opposite to the sign of Web Mercator northings. So, when using Web Mercator northings for the z coordinates of our 3D world, we need to remember to reverse the sign.</em></p>
</p>
<h3>How to convert between latitude/longitude and Web Mercator</h3>
<p>Using mathematical formulae, latitude and longitude can be converted to Web Mercator. However, because it is a common operation, various libraries can do it for you. We will use the library <code>jsfreemaplib</code>. Here is an example:
<pre>
import { GoogleProjection } from 'jsfreemaplib';

// Create a GoogleProjection object. This object is responsible for conversions
// between lon/lat and Web Mercator (aka 'Google Projection')
const merc = new GoogleProjection();

const lon = -0.72;
const lat = 51.05;

// project the lon and lat into Web Mercator.
// returns an array with two members, first is easting and second is northing
const projected = merc.project(lon, lat);

// Output the easting and northing, and corresponding x and z coordinates, 
// remembering to change sign of the northing before using it for a z coordinate
console.log(`Easting: ${projected[0]}, x: ${projected[0]}, northing: ${projected[1]}, z: ${-projected[1]}`);
</pre>
You should install <code>jsfreemaplib</code> from NPM. In your <code>package.json</code>, specify version 0.4.0 or greater, e.g.:
<pre>{
    "dependencies": {
        "jsfreemaplib", "^0.4.0",
        ...
    },
    ...
}</pre>
</p>
<h2>The Geolocation API</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Geolocation API allows you to obtain the current location of the
device running the browser from within JavaScript. Even on desktop browsers
this will give a result if you are using a wireless network, but its real
use is in the mobile web development world. A mobile browser can talk to the
GPS chip of the phone and obtain the phone's current location on the earth.
Alternatively, if the GPS chip is not available, a rough estimate can be
obtained from cell towers or wireless networks.</p>
<h4>Using the Geolocation API</h4>
<p>It is fairly straightforward to use the Geolocation API. Here is an 
example (<strong>please note - all examples in this topic will show the JavaScript only, not the HTML</strong>):
<pre>
if(navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition (
            gpspos=&gt; {
                console.log(`Lat ${gpspos.coords.latitude} Lon ${gpspos.coords.longitude}`); // show on the console
            },

            err=&gt; {
                alert(`An error occurred: ${err.code}`);
            }

        );
} else {
    alert("Sorry, geolocation not supported in this browser");
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>How is this working?
    <ul>
    <li>The code
    tests whether geolocation is possible in our browser by checking for the
    existence of the <em>navigator.geolocation</em> variable. If it doesn't
    exist, we display an error. If it <em>does</em> exist, we tell the
    geolocation object to obtain the current position with 
    <em>getCurrentPosition()</em>. This takes two arguments, both functions:
        <ul>
        <li>The first argument (an arrow function here)
        is the function that will run as soon as we get a 
        location back from the GPS chip (or wireless network, etc)</li>
        <li>The second (here, another arrow function) will run if there
        was an error obtaining the location.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Note the <em>asynchronous</em> approach here, just like AJAX. It might
    take time to obtain a position, so we set up a <em>callback</em>
    function to run once we have obtained the position, and continue
    processing in the meantime. So any statements below the 
    <em>getCurrentPosition()</em> might run before 
    the first arrow function starts running.
    </li>
    <li>Considering each of these two functions in turn, let's look at
    the first. This is automatically supplied with
    one parameter, <em>gpspos</em>, which is an object 
    representing the position returned from the GPS device or other location provider. This object has a property <em>coords</em> representing the
    coordinates, and <em>coords</em> itself has two properties,
    <em>latitude</em> and <em>longitude</em>.
    Therefore, we can obtain the latitude and
    longitude with <em>gpspos.coords.latitude</em> and 
    <em>gpspos.coords.longitude</em>. So what this example is doing is
    displaying the coordinates in the console (you can view the console
    via More Tools-Developer Tools in Chrome or Web Developer-Web Console
    in Firefox).</li>
    <li>Moving onto the second arrow function, which is the function which
    is run if there is any sort of error in obtaining the position: again, 
    this is automatically supplied with one parameter, <em>err</em>,
    an object representing the exact error which occurred. The most meaningful
    property of <em>err</em> is a numerical code, <em>err.code</em>, which
    is what we are displaying here. There are several codes
    (ref <a href='http://www.diveintohtml5.info/geolocation.html'>Dive into 
    HTML5</a>, Mark Pilgrim):
        <ul>
        <li>1 means that the user denied the browser access to the device's
        location. For security reasons, a user has to agree to the browser
        accessing the device's GPS chip, and if they deny that access, the
        error function will run with a code of 1.</li>
        <li>2 means that the location could not be obtained, e.g the
        GPS satellites or wireless networks are unavailable;</li>
        <li>3 means a timeout, i.e. the GPS satellites or network are 
        available but it has taken too long to contact them.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Watching the position</h3>
<p>The above code will simply obtain the current position and stop. In a
typical mobile GPS application, however, the user will want to be informed
of their location on a regular basis. To do this we use 
<em>watchPosition()</em> in place of <em>getCurrentPosition()</em>. Here is
an example:
<pre>
if(navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.watchPosition (

        gpspos=&gt; {
            console.log(`Lat ${gpspos.coords.latitude} Lon ${gpspos.coords.longitude}`); // show on the console
        },

        err=&gt; {
            alert(`An error occurred: ${err.code}`);
        },

        {
            enableHighAccuracy:true, 
            maximumAge: 5000 
        }

    );
} else {
    alert("Sorry, geolocation not supported in this browser");
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note that the code is almost the same as the first example, except:
    <ul>
    <li>We use <em>watchPosition()</em> rather than 
    <em>getCurrentPosition()</em>. The result will be that the GPS chip 
    (or other location provider) will communicate the current location back
    to the process position arrow 
    function every time the location changes, rather 
    than just the once.</li>
    <li>Note also the additional options passed as a third parameter to
    <em>watchPosition()</em>. On many mobile devices, if we want to use the
    GPS chip (rather than cell towers, wireless networks, etc) we have
    to set the <em>enableHighAccuracy</em> option to <em>true</em>. Also
    if we want to force the GPS to return a reading every so-many seconds,
    we have to specify a value for the <em>maximumAge</em> option, in 
    milliseconds. So the above example will refresh at least every 5 
    seconds.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>IMPORTANT - Geolocation API now needs HTTPS server</h3>
<p>For security reasons (the risk of your location being intercepted by packet-sniffers) the Geolocation API now requires the use of an HTTPS server (a web server with encrypted communication), on both Chrome and Firefox.  If you are running on <code>localhost</code> (your own local machine), however, HTTPS is not needed.</p> <p>See <a href='https://letsencrypt.org'>Let's Encrypt</a> for information on setting up an HTTPS server.</p>
<h2 id="geojson">GeoJSON</h2>
<p>What format does this API return? It returns a specific JSON format known as <em>GeoJSON</em> (see <a href="https://geojson.org">geojson.org</a>). GeoJSON is designed to represent geographic data in a standard way.</p>
<p>GeoJSON consists of a series of objects. These are:
    <ul>
    <li><em>Features</em>: a feature represents a geographical feature, such
    as a road, a path, a pub or a restaurant. Each feature has a 
    <em>geometry</em> (see below) and a series of <em>properties</em>.</li>
    <li><em>Geometries</em>: a geometry is the representation of the 
    <em>shape</em> of the feature. For a point of interest, this would simply
    be a point (defined by latitude and longitude); for a more complex feature
    such as a road, a path or the outline of a building, it would be a series of
    points making up either a <em>LineString</em> (a linear series of points)
    or a <em>Polygon</em> (a series of points arranged in a loop). LineStrings
    would typically represent linear features such as roads or paths, while
    Polygons would represent features such as lakes, buildings or woods.</li>
    <li>a <em>FeatureCollection</em> is, as the name implies, a collection of
    features.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Here is an example of some GeoJSON.
<pre>
{
    type: "FeatureCollection":
    features:
    [
        {
            type: "Feature",
            geometry:
            {
                type: "Point",
                coordinates: [-0.72, 51.05]    
            },
            properties:
            {
                poiType: "pub",
                name: "The Red Lion"
            }    
        },

        {
            type: "Feature",
            geometry:
            {
                type: "Point",
                coordinates: [-0.9, 51.1]
            },
            properties:
            {
                poiType: "restaurant",
                name: "Sams Burger Joint"
            }
        },

        {
            type: "Feature",
            geometry:
            {
                type: "LineString",
                coordinates: [
                    [-1, 51],
                    [-1.01, 50.99],
                    [-1.01, 50.98],
                    [-1.02, 50.97],
                    [-1.04, 50.96]
                        ]
            },
            properties:
            {
                poiType: "main road",
                number: "A987",
                name: "High Street"
            }
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
Note how this GeoJSON consists of a <em>FeatureCollection</em>. The
FeatureCollection in turn contains an array of <em>Feature</em> objects,
each of which contains three fields:
    <ul>
    <li>The <em>type</em>. This is just 'Feature', so that any client 
    application reading this GeoJSON is able to recognise that it's a
    feature;</li>
    <li>The <em>geometry</em>. This represents the actual points making up
    the feature. The geometry in turn has two fields, the <em>type</em>
    (e.g. Point, LineString, Polygon) and the <em>coordinates</em>. For
    a <em>Point</em>, the coordinates is simply an array with two members,
     the longitude and latitude respectively. For a <em>LineString</em>, the
    coordinates consists of an array of points, where each 
    point is itself a two-member array containing longitude and latitude.
    In other words, it is an array of arrays.</li>
    <li>The <em>properties</em>. This is a collection of variable/value
    pairs representing properties of the feature. In the road example
    above, there are three properties, the <em>poiType</em> (main road),  
    <em>number</em> (A987) and <em>name</em> (High Street). Note that these
    are not keywords: you are free to choose the property names yourself.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p><p>So, to parse this GeoJSON from JavaScript, you could use code such as:</p>
<pre>
// Await a response from the GeoJSON API 
const response = await fetch('GeoJSON API');

// Parse the JSON.
const parsedJson = await response.json();

// Loop through each feature in the GeoJSON.
parsedJson.features.forEach ( feature =&gt; {
    // Print the name
    console.log(`Name: ${feature.properties.name}`);

    // If it's a point, print the coordinates
    if(feature.geometry.type == 'Point') {
        console.log(`Longitude: ${feature.geometry.coordinates[0]}, latitude: ${feature.geometry.coordinates[1]}`);
    }
});
</pre>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>The exercise is to bring this all together and dynamically create a scene
by contacting a web API to retrieve JSON. At the URL
<pre>https://hikar.org/webapp/map/peaks?bbox=west,south,east,north</pre>
(where <code>west</code>, <code>south</code>, <code>east</code> and <code>north</code> are the west, south, east and north bounds of the area to download) is a server-side application which returns JSON of mountain peaks from <a href='https://openstreetmap.org'>OpenStreetMap</a>.
</p>
<h3>Faking your location</h3>
<p>To test a peak finder, the university is obviously not a very mountainous location so you need to <em>fake</em> a mountainous location. Furthermore, on a desktop or laptop, you will not get a reliable location anyway because these machines do not have a GPS chip.</p>
<p>How can we fake our location? You can download the <strong>Location Guard</strong> extension for either <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/location-guard/cfohepagpmnodfdmjliccbbigdkfcgia">Chrome</a>. This will allow you to set a fake location for your browser, which will be reported when the Geolocation API is used in any application. (This also has the side-effect of hiding your real location from websites which may wish to gather this information for less-than-ethical purposes).</p>
<p><img src="../images/fixedloc1.png" alt="Location Guard - Pick your location" /></p>
<p>After you install, you will see a screen rather like the above. Select <strong>Fixed Location</strong>. This will give you a map which you can drag. Move to somewhere mountainous in <strong>Europe or Turkey</strong>, which are the areas covered by the server. A suggestion for a fake location is latitude 47.45, longitude 11.05 - this is an area with many mountains.</p>
<p>Then, once you have chosen a fake location, select Options and then choose "Use fixed location" for "Default level", as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="../images/fixedloc2.png" alt="Location Guard - Levels" /></p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>Build an A-Frame or a three.js application which contacts this
URL, and downloads the data from it (using the fetch API). You will need to use Location Guard, see above, to ensure you fake your location to somewhere mountainous. If using A-Frame, create a component to do this, attach it to your scene, and add the code to the <code>init()</code> method, i.e.
<pre>AFRAME.registerComponent("downloader", {
    init: function() {
        // put your code in here...

        // Note how the geolocation callback function is declared async to
        // allow us to use await for the fetch call
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(<strong>async</strong>(gpspos) =&gt; {
        //...
      });
    }
});</pre>
In pure three.js, you can add the download code any time after your scene is loaded.</p>
<p>The steps you need to take are:
<ol>
<li>Enter the URL of the web API in your browser directly, to be familiar with the data sent back and its format. For example, enter:
<pre>https://hikar.org/webapp/map/peaks?bbox=11,47.4,11.1,47.5</pre>
To view the JSON nicely formatted I would recommend installing an extension such as <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh/related'>JSON Viewer for Chrome</a>.</li>
<li>Use the Geolocation API to obtain your current position, as latitude and longitude. Convert the latitude and longitude into Web Mercator and set the x and z coordinates of the camera appropriately. Remember to reverse the sign of z!
    <ul>
	<li>To set the camera position, use code such as the below to find the camera entity and update its position:
	<pre>
	document.querySelector("[camera]").setAttribute("position", {
		x: mercatorEasting,
		y: 0,
		z: -mercatorNorthing
	});
	</pre>
	Note how in this code we ding the camera with the square brackets syntax <code>[camera]</code>. Square brackets in CSS select any element with that attribute present. In A-Frame this is equivalent to selecting an entity with the given component present. So here, we are selecting the entity which contains the <code>camera</code> component, i.e. our camera entity. 
	</li>
    <li><strong>Also, please use <code>getCurrentPosition()</code> and not <code>watchPosition()</code>! While in a real app you would probably use <code>watchPosition()</code> I don't want my server being bombarded with requests during the lab session!</strong></li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>When the location updates, send a new request to the server. Send a bounding box with the values: 
    <ul>
    <li>West: your current longitude - 0.05</li>
    <li>South: your current latitude - 0.05</li>
    <li>East: your current longitude + 0.05</li>
    <li>North: your current latitude + 0.05</li>
    </ul>
Use the fetch API to send the data. The server will send back GeoJSON. To embed the values in the URL, you can use the backtick syntax, e.g:
<pre>const response = await fetch(`https://hikar.org/webapp/map/peaks?bbox=${west},${south},${east},${north}`);</pre>
where <code>west</code>, <code>south</code>, <code>east</code> and <code>north</code> are the bounds of the area to download.
<br />
You should parse the JSON, and create cones for each feature. Create A-Frame entities or three.js meshes for each point of interest at the appropriate coordinates. You need to convert the latitude and longitude supplied by the JSON into Web Mercator, see above. Remember to reverse the sign of z! Also make sure the cone is large (e.g. radius 100m, height 300m) otherwise you won't be able to see it from a distance.</li>
<li>Test it. To change the location you'll need to set a new location in Location Guard while your application is running.</li>
<li>Add code so that an alert box with the name and elevation (<code>ele</code>) of the peak appears when you click on it. You should be able to work out how to do this from the mouse events section from week 5. Note that you will need an additional <code>raycaster</code> component added to the scene. The <code>raycaster</code> component defines the start (near) and end (far) distance of the ray cast from the mouse position which is used to detect mouse clicks. You should set the end distance to 10000 units to detect peaks up to 10km (10000m) away, e.g.
<pre>&lt;a-scene cursor='rayOrigin: mouse' <strong>raycaster='near:0.1; far: 10000'</strong>&gt;</li>
<li>Change your code to colour the cones differently depending on elevation: 
    <ul>
    <li>If there is no elevation provided, use red;</li>

<h2>Assignment URL - preview</h2>
<p>Next week, week 8, we will look at <em>tiling</em> which is the most efficient way of downloading the data from the server. However here is a quick preview, to allow you to start looking at the assignment if you are doing the Points of Interest scenario. The URL to use will be
<pre>https://hikar.org/webapp/map/Z/X/Y.poi.json</pre>
where Z, X and Y are the coordinates of the data <em>tile</em> to use. (A tile is a rectangular area covering part of the Earth). To obtain the tile for a given latitude and longitude, you can use <code>jsfreemaplib</code> again, e.g.:
<pre>
import { GoogleProjection } from 'jsfreemaplib';

const merc = new GoogleProjection();

// Use zoom level 13 - this is a good size
// assume 'longitude' and 'latitude' contain your current longitude/latitude
const tile = merc.getTileFromLonLat(longitude, latitude, 13);

// <em>tile</em> is an object of class Tile. It has x, y and z properties
// These can be used to download data from the assignment URL
console.log(`Tile x: ${tile.x}, y: ${tile.y}, z: ${tile.z}`);
</pre>
