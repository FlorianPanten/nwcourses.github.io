<h1>MAD Topic 3 : Further Basic Android: ConstraintLayout, Build Files, Third-Party Libraries</h1> 
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This week we will look at a range of further introductory topics including  <em>ConstraintLayout</em>, the <em>build.gradle</em> file, <em>Jetpack</em>, adding <em>third-party libraries</em> and a quick introduction to <em>mapping</em>, which will preview material covered next week.</p>
<h2>ConstraintLayout</h2>
<p>The <em>ConstraintLayout</em> is a more advanced layout manager than the simple <em>LinearLayout</em> that we looked at last week. With ConstraintLayout, more complex layouts can be created relatively simply in your XML.
The idea is that we position elements by setting <em>constraints</em> -
where they should be in relation to other elements</p>
<h3>Simple ConstraintLayout example</h3>
 <pre>&lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity"&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/pleaseEnterYourName"
        android:textSize="12pt"
        android:id="@+id/tv1"
        app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"/&gt;

       
    &lt;EditText
            android:layout_width="0dp"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:id="@+id/et1"
            app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
            app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
            app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@id/tv1"
            /&gt;

     

&lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;
</pre>
<p>This produces the layout below. Note that the <em>constraints</em>
are shown as lines connecting each element to either the parent (the
ConstraintLayout as a whole) or to another element. So the TextView is
constrained by the three blue constraints (the top to the top of the
parent, the left to the left of the parent, and the right to the right of the
parent) while the EditText is constrained by the three red constraints (the
top to the bottom of the TextView, the left to the left of the parent, and
the right to the right of the parent).
<br />
<img src='../images/constraintlayout1.png' alt='Constraint Layout, example 1' />
<br />
</p>
<p>Explaining the XML in more detail: note how our top level layout is a <em>ConstraintLayout</em> and how we place a <em>TextView</em> and an <em>EditText</em> inside the ConstraintLayout. We position the TextView and EditText <em>relative to each other</em> and <em>relative to the parent layout</em> (the ConstraintLayout, which occupies the whole of the activity) using <em>constraints</em>.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will consider the TextView. Note its constraints:
<pre>app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"</pre>
To explain this (line by line):
    <ul><li>The left side of TextView will be constrained to the left hand side of the parent
    (the layout as a whole)</li>
    <li>The right side and top side of the TextView will similarly be constrained to the
    right and top of the parent, respectively</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Also note how the TextView has a layout width of 0dp (density-independent pixels; a measurement aimed to deal with different pixel-density screens). This is specifying that <em>the constraints will be used to set the width</em>.
Note how the TextView's left and right sides are constrained to the left and right sides of the parent, so it is this that decides the width if the <em>layout_width</em> is set to 0dp.</p>
<p>We then place an EditText in the layout. This will appear below the TextView due to:
<pre>app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@id/tv1"</pre>
which literally means <strong>constrain the edit text so that its top is at the bottom
of the element with the ID of tv1</strong> (i.e. the TextView)
</p>
<h3>A more complex example</h3>
<pre>
&lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity"&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/enterYourName"
        android:textSize="12pt"
        android:id="@+id/tv1"
        app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent"/&gt;

        &lt;Button
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:id="@+id/btn1"
            android:text="@string/sayHello"
            app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
            app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@id/tv1"
            /&gt;


        &lt;EditText
            android:layout_width="0dp"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:id="@+id/et1"
            app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
            app:layout_constraintRight_toLeftOf="@id/btn1"
            app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@id/tv1"
            /&gt;

    &lt;TextView
        android:layout_width="0dp"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Enter feet:"
        android:textSize="12pt"
        android:id="@+id/tvResult"
        app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@id/et1"/&gt;

      
&lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;</pre>
<p>This produces the layout below, again with the constraints shown:
<br />
<img src='../images/constraintlayout2.png' alt='Constraint Layout, example 2' />
<br />
</p>
<p>This layout contains a text view at the top, a button and an edit text on the next line and a text view at the bottom.  Note the constraints of the Button and the EditText:
    <ul>
    <li>The Button's right hand side is constrained to be on the right hand side of the
    parent (so it will appear justified to the right), 
    and its top is constrained to be at the bottom of <em>tv1</em> (the first
    TextView). It does not need any other constraints; that is sufficient to position it.</li>
    <li>The EditText's left hand side is constrained to be on the left hand side of the
    parent (so it will appear justified to the left) and, like the Button, is constrained to
    be below <em>tv1</em>, but, also, <strong>its right hand side is constrained to be
    left of btn1</strong></li>
    <li>Thus, we can <em>add elements in right to left order</em> as long as the constraints
    applied are appropriate</li>
    <li>Note how the EditText has a layout_width of 0dp (see above): 
    this will ensure that it fills all
    the space between the left hand side of the parent and the left hand side of <em>et1</em>
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Including ConstraintLayout in your project</h3>
<p>ConstraintLayout is available as part of the <em>Jetpack libraries</em>, so include it into your project by specifying it in the <em>build.gradle</em> file (see below). However, by default, Android Studio adds it so you do not need to explicitly include it.</p>
<h3>Competing constraints and bias</h3>
<p><em>This example is inspired by the similar example from the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout">Android documentation</a>.</em></p>
<p>It is possible to set up constraints so that they "compete" against each
other. For example, imagine this button:
<pre>
&lt;Button
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        android:text="@string/click"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@id/tvResult" /&gt;
</pre>
This button has a <code>layout_width</code> of <code>wrap_content</code>, so
it will only occupy as much width as needed to contain its text. However, note
that it has two competing constraints on its left and right side: om the left,
it's constrained to the left of its parent, but on the right, it's constrained
to the right of its parent. What will happen here is that both constraints will
pull the button in opposite directions, so that it appears in the centre of
the parent. This is shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/competingconstraints.png" alt="Competing constraints" />
<br />
</p>
<p>To make one competing constraint count more than the other, we can use
constraint <em>bias</em>. For example, look at this code:
<pre>
&lt;Button
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:layout_constraintLeft_toLeftOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintRight_toRightOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintHorizontal_bias="0.3"
        android:text="@string/click"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="@id/tvResult" /&gt;
</pre>
Note how there is now a <em>horizontal bias of 0.3</em> in the constraints.
This will mean that the left constraint will count more than the right
constraint, so that the button is centred at 0.3 of the total width of the
parent (rather than 0.5 by default), so that it appears towards the left, as
shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/constraintbias.png" alt="Constraint bias" />
<br />
If we were to use a bias greater than 0.5, the right constraint would count
more than the left, and it would appear towards the right of the parent.</p>
<p>We can also use <code>app:layout_constraintVertical_bias</code> in exactly
the same way, to control the bias of vertical constraints.</p>
<h3>More on ConstraintLayout</h3>
<p>For more on ConstraintLayout, 
see the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout">documentation on the Android developer site</a>.</p>
<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Change your calculator app from last week to use a ConstraintLayout (or, if you did not complete it, start it now using a ConstraintLayout). It should have a layout as below:
<br />
<img src='../images/calculatorlayout.png' alt='Layout for calculator using ConstraintLayout' />
</li>
<li>Change the layout so that the four operation buttons (+, -, * and /) are
on one row.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Application builds - examining the build.gradle file</h2>
<p>We are now going to take a look at the app's <em>build.gradle</em> file and examine key features of this build file, namely how to include <em>third-party dependencies</em> and <em>how to set the minimum, compilation and target API levels</em>.</p>
<p>Many Android apps depend on <em>third-party libraries</em> written by independent developers. Many of these are FOSS (free and open-source software) meaning, amongst other things, you can use them freely in your own projects. Dependencies are added to the <em>build.gradle</em> file.</p>
<h3>Linking libraries to your app</h3>
<p>You should link third-party dependencies to your app via the <em>dependencies</em> section of the <em>build.gradle</em> file. <em>build.gradle</em> is a build file: a set of instructions used by <em>Gradle</em> to create your app from your code and any third-party libraries it may require. Gradle is a standalone tool (can be used outside Android Studio, so you can build your apps with Gradle and without Studio if you wish), but is included within Android Studio.</p>
<p>Note there are two <em>build.gradle</em> files, one for the whole project and one for your app specifically. It is the latter (the <em>app</em> build.gradle; the <em>second</em> one as seen in Android Studio) that you need to edit. An app build.gradle is shown below.
</p>
<p>
<img src="../images/buildgradle.png" alt="app build.gradle file" />
</p>
<h3>Android Jetpack</h3>
<p>The first example of libraries we will look at is <em>Android Jetpack</em>. Jetpack libraries are developed by the Android dev team but are separate to the mmain Android API. It is currently recommended, when developing for Android, to make use of Jetpack. Jetpack is a collection of libraries that add more specialised, and recently-developed, features to Android. Before API level 28, these features were included as part of the core Android API. However, because many new features were added to Android after API leve 22 (Android 5.x upwards) at a time when many devices were still running older versions of Android, a problem arose in that many devices could not use these newer features by default. Consequently, the <em>appcompat</em> library was maintained to provide these new features to older Android versions, however because new features were added all the time, it became rather unmanageable.</p>
<p>Consequently, Jetpack was created. The philosophy of Jetpack is to focus the core Android API on the core, less-frequently-updated features and add the newer, more specialised, more rapidly-changing features in separate <em>Jetpack libraries</em>. This allows older devices to support new features in a "clean" way: an older version of the core API can work together with the latest versions of Jetpack libraries to produce an app with many new and interesting features but which can run on older Android versions. Jetpack libraries belong to <code>androidx</code> packages.</p>
<p>The use of Jetpack also cuts down the size of the app if not all Jetpack features are desired, as we only link in those Jetpack libraries we need.</p>

<p>Examples of Jetpack components include:
	<ul>
	<li>The AppCompat (backwards-compatibility) library</li>
	<li>ConstraintLayout (which we have explored above)</li>
	<li>RecyclerView: a memory-efficient approach to creating lists and other views of data (to be covered later)</li>
    <li>KTX: a series of components which allow Android development using Kotlin language features</li>
	<li>CameraX: an easy-to-use camera API</li>
	<li>Fragments (to be covered later)</li>
    <li>Lifecycle: for managing Android component lifecycle</li>
	<li>Full list <a href='https://developer.android.com/jetpack#foundation-components'>here</a>.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Jetpack libaries need to be added to the <code>dependencies</code> section of your app's <em>build.gradle</em>. Some are added already: if you look at the <em>build.gradle</em> example above, all the dependencies beginning with <code>androidx</code> are Jetpack libraries, for example the AppCompat and ConstraintLayout libraries:
<pre>implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0'
implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.0.4'</pre>
</p>
<h3>Minimum, compilation and target SDK versions</h3>
<p>The next thing we are going to look at in the build.gradle are the <code>sdkVersion</code> specifiers. Note the three lines showing <code>compileSdkVersion</code>, <code>minSdkVersion</code> and <code>targetSdkVersion</code>. What do these represent?
	<ul>
	<li><code>minSdkVersion</code> is the easiest of the three to understand. It represents the minimum API level needed to run your application. So for example if <code>minSdkVersion</code> is 19, then your app will only run on Android 4.4 (KitKat) upwards, because API level 19 is equivalent to KitKat.</li>
	<li><code>compileSdkVersion</code> represents the API the software is <em>compiled against</em>. If you use features from a recent API level, but the <code>compileSdkVersion</code> is lower, then your code <em>will not compile</em> because your code is being compiled against an older version of the API, one without the recent features. Note that if, on the other hand, you set the <code>compileSdkVersion</code> to a <em>recent</em> version of Android and use features from a recent API level (e.g. API 30) then try to run it on a device running an <em>older</em> version of Android, the code will crash with a runtime error. (However, in Android Studio, the <em>lint</em> code analysis tool will pick up attempts to use recent API features if the <code>minSdkVersion</code> is below the API level needed for the feature).</li>
	<li><code>targetSdkVersion</code> represents the SDK the app is <em>targeting</em>. This defines <em>what standards will be followed</em> when you build your project; in other words, are you using the recommended features of an up-to-date version of Android or an older one? For example, occasionally Android API features are marked as <em>deprecated</em> (outdated) at a certain API level (for example 26), because it is recommended you replace the feature with a newer approach to doing the same task. If your <code>targetSdkVersion</code> is that API level (26 for example) or higher, and you try to use the deprecated feature, you will get a warning. However, if your <code>targetSdkVersion</code> is lower than this (25 or less, for example), you will not. <br />As another example, from API level 23 upwards, <em>runtime permission handling</em> was introduced, in which users must grant an app permission to perform sensitive operations (e.g. take pictures) when the app is run. If the <code>targetSdkVersion</code> is 23 or more, you will not be able to perform sensitive operations in your code without runtime permission checking - the app will crash with a SecurityException. (Again, the lint tool will detect this in Android Studio before you attempt to deploy it). If, however, the <code>targetSdkVersion</code> is 22 or less, you will not have to implement runtime permission checking, even if running on a device running Marshmallow (API 23) or greater.<br />That said, it is not wise to remove deprecation warnings, or the need to use newer development approaches (such as runtime permission checking), simply by dropping the <code>targetSdkVersion</code>. This is a signal that your app is using outdated APIs, which may be completely dropped in the future; and furthermore, to publish on Google Play, the <code>targetSdkVersion</code> needs to be recent - usually the version before the current version, so currently 29 - otherwise it cannot be published).</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Third-party libraries</h3>
<p>We can also make use of <em>third-party</em> libraries in our apps by
adding them to <em>build.gradle</em> as dependencies. These are libraries
developed by people other than the Android developer team. We are going to
look at a <em>mapping</em> library called <em>osmroid</em>.</p>
<p>We are going to add the <em>osmdroid</em> mapping library to our app as an example of a dependency. This will allow us to add a map to our main activity. It can be added to the <code>dependencies</code> section of the app's <em>build.gradle</em> as an additional dependency:
<pre>
<strong>implementation</strong> 'org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:6.1.0'
</pre>
</p>
<p>Where is the OSMDroid library coming from? If you have used a build system
such as Maven in standard Java, you might recognise the technique used. It
downloads the OSMDroid library from an <em>online repository of Java
libraries</em>. The specific repository used by default is <em>Bintray JCenter</em>, which can be found <a href='https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter'>here</a>. Another common repository (which you will have come across if you have studied OODD) is <a href="https://search.maven.org">Maven Central</a>.</p>
<p> Once the dependency has been
downloaded, it will be saved on your computer so that it will not need to
be downloaded next time you open the project.</p>
<p>The repositories used are specified in the <em>project build.gradle</em>
file (the other one; the first build.gradle in the project view of Android Studio); you'll notice the <em>jcenter()</em> line in there which specifies that JCenter is being used.</p>
<h3>More on osmdroid</h3>
<p>Most location-based apps include a map as the content view of their main activity.  Android comes with inbuilt map functionality via Google Maps; however to use Google Maps you need to obtain an API key and it comes with some restrictions so we are going to use an alternative mapping library: <em>osmdroid</em>, available <a href='http://www.github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid'>here</a>. (A <em>library</em> is a collection of Java classes with related functionality, such as mapping). As a Java library, you can use it in a Kotlin app.</p>
<p>osmdroid is a third-party open source library which uses
maps from the <a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org'>OpenStreetMap</a> project. OpenStreetMap is a global
project to provide free and open mapping data which anyone can contribute to;
see <a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org'>the website</a> for more details. In using
osmdroid, you will also see how to add external libraries to an Android project.
</p>
<h3>Latitude and Longitude</h3>
<p>In order to understand location-based applications, it is important
to understand the coordinate system used on the earth. The most common
coordinate system uses <em>latitude and longitude</em>. Latitude is a measure
of how far north or south you are: the equator is at 0 degrees,
while the North Pole is at 90 degrees North, we are at about 50 and Spain
is at about 40. Longitude is a measure of how far east or west you are:
0 degrees of longitude is referred to as the <em>Prime Meridian</em>
(or <em>Greenwich Meridian</em>) and passes through Greenwich, London. 
By contrast Germany is located
between approximately 7 degrees and 15 degrees East, while New York is at
74 degrees West and the west coast of North America at approximately 120
degrees West.</p>
<p><img src="../images/latlon.png" alt="Latitude and longitude" /></p>
<p>So a given point on the earth can be defined via its latitude and
longitude. The university is at approximately, 50.9 North (latitude) and 1.4 West (longitude). By convention, latitudes north of the equator and longitudes
east of Greenwich are treated as positive, so we can also define our
position as <strong>longitude -1.4, latitude +50.9</strong>.</p>
<h3>Mapping code</h3>
<p>Here is a sample app using the OSMDroid Android API
Copy-and-paste this code into your <em>Mapping</em> project's <code>MainActivity.kt</code>.
</ul>
<pre>
package com.example.mapping

import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
import android.preference.PreferenceManager
import org.osmdroid.config.Configuration
import org.osmdroid.util.GeoPoint
import org.osmdroid.views.MapView

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        // This line sets the user agent, a requirement to download OSM maps
        Configuration.getInstance().load(this, PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this));

        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        val map1 = findViewById&lt;MapView&gt;(R.id.map1)
        map1.controller.setZoom(14.0)
        map1.controller.setCenter(GeoPoint(51.05, -0.72))

    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>The main XML layout file is here. Copy and paste it into <code>activity_main.xml</code>.
<pre>
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"&gt;
&lt;org.osmdroid.views.MapView
    android:layout_width="match_parent" 
    android:layout_height="match_parent" 
    android:enabled="true"
    android:clickable="true"
    android:id="@+id/map1"
    tilesource="Mapnik"
    /&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how this is working:
<ul>
<li>In the XML layout, we add a component of type <em>MapView</em>, but because
MapView is not part of the standard Android library, we have to include its 
complete qualified name, including the package it belongs to, i.e.
<em>org.osmdroid.views.MapView</em>.</li>
<li>The main activity is actually quite straightforward. We obtain the MapView
using its ID (as we have done with other components before) and then set the    
zoom level (16; higher numbers are zoomed in further) 
and the centre point of the map, in latitude and longitude.
For more on latitude and longitude, see
<a href='http://www.free-map.org.uk/course/wad_new/webmapping.php'>here</a>.
For more on zoom levels, see <a href="#zoomdetail">below</a>, and
<a href=
'http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/overlays.html#Google_Maps_Coordinates'>
Google's article on zoom levels</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>The manifest file and Permissions</h3>
<p>The manifest file is an XML file describing the app and its components
(e.g. the activities making up the app), as well as the app
<em>permissions</em> (see below). It is called <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>
and can be found in the <code>manifests</code> directory.</p>
<p>Apps need to be granted <em>permissions</em> to perform sensitive 
operations. Sensitive operations can include:
    <ul>
    <li><em>Using the internet</em> - because this might incur a cost to
    the user, and have potential privacy/security concerns;</li>
    <li><em>Tracking your location</em> - because this could be potentially
    abused (e.g. by stalkers)</li>
    <li><em>Reading from and writing to files</em> - again this has
    security concerns.</li>    
    </ul>
</p>
<p>We will look at permissions in more detail next time. For now, we just
need to add one permission to the manifest file:
    <ul>
    <li>INTERNET - needed to download the maps from the internet</li>
    </ul>
So ensure your manifest file contains the following permissions. They should
go <strong>before the &lt;application&gt; tag.</strong>
<pre>
&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Try the example above out. It should show a map of Fernhurst, West Sussex
(about 30 miles/50km east of the university).</li>
<li>Use the site <a href="http://www.informationfreeway.org">
informationfreeway.org</a> to look up the latitude and longitude of your
home town. Make the map centre on your home town instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exercise 3</h3>
<p>This exercise allows you to revise the previous topics.
Enhance your
app so that it has a UI with a layout similar to that shown below. <em>Create the XML by hand as a ConstraintLayout; do not use the UI designer.</em>
<br />
<img src="../images/consolidation_layout.png" alt="Consolidation exercise layout" 
/>
