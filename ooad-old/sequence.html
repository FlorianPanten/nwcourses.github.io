<ul>
<li>Allow us to design the system in detail</li>
<li>This is the step in the analysis and design where we work out
interactions between classes in the system, in the form of methods</li>
<li>They also help us work out the <em>sequence</em> in which methods are called
- hence the name!</li>
<li>Once we're done with sequence diagrams, we can fill in our class diagrams 
in full and begin coding</li>
<li>Thus it is important to get them right!</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 2</p><h1>How to do a sequence diagram</h1>
<ul>
<li>The use case text and robustness diagram are both used</li>
<li>When we did the robustness diagram, we worked out what classes from the
domain model are required for each step in the use case</li>
<li>Each interaction between a use case step (or controller object in the
robustness diagram) and a domain model object roughly translates to a 
method call</li>
<li>Because we worked out the classes needed for each step of the use case in 
the robustness diagram, the robustness diagram makes the process much easier
</li>
<li>Typically, a controller on the robustness diagram translates to one (or 
maybe more) method(s) on the sequence diagram</li>
<li>This should be done for alternative courses as well as the normal course 
of events - though often, it may be trivial for alternative courses of
action</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 3</p><h1>Notation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sequence diagrams show the interaction between classes in the 
system</li>
<li>We say that one class (class A) sends another class (class B) a 
<em>message</em></li>
<li>In code, this translates to class A calling a method of class B</li>
<li>The arrow on the line connecting the two classes shows the direction of 
the message</li>
<li>Sometimes one class sends itself a message (e.g see checkDetailsEntered()
in the first example, below)</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 4</p><h1>Example 1 - Add Member</h1>
<p><img src="../images/sequence1_new.png" alt="DVD library - add member  - sequence diagram"></p>
<ul>
<li>The first two things that need to be done are to check that details
were entered in the GUI and to check that the date of birth was valid
	<ul>
	<li>The GUI does not need to communicate with any other classes to 
	do this, so we have a "circular" arrow to show that the
	GUI class is <em>sending a message to itself</em></li>
	<li>Each check can be done by a GUI method, 
	<em>checkDetailsEntered()</em> and <em>checkDOB()</em></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The GUI then needs to check if the member exists already; it sends a
message to the DVDLibrary, passing it the name and address
(the <em>checkMemberExists</em> method) 
	<ul>
	<li>We worked out in the robustness diagram that DVDLibrary should be
	responsible for checking if a member exists, which makes it easier to
	draw up the sequence diagram</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The GUI then sends the DVDLibrary a message to allocate a new ID
	<ul>
	<li>The DVDLibrary is the class that will know what the highest ID
	so far is, so therefore GUI needs to talk to DVDLibrary to do this</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The GUI then sends the Member class a message to create a new Member object with
the allocated ID and supplied details
	<ul>
	<li>The GUI sends a <em>create</em> message to Member</li>
	<li>A <em>create</em> message is a special type of message which creates
	a new instance of a specified class</li>
	<li>Translates to a constructor in code</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally the GUI sends the DVDLibrary a message to add the new
Member</li>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="../images/sequence2_new.png" alt="Search for member sequence diagram">
</p>
<ul>
<li>First the GUI communicates with the DVDLibrary to retrieve a member
with a given ID
	<ul>
	<li>The GUI needs to send a message to DVDLibrary, because
	DVDLibrary is responsible for retrieving a member by ID (we would work
	this out on the robustness diagram)</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Once we've retrieved the member, m, we then need to retrieve its details
to display on the GUI 
	<ul> 
	<li>This is shown on the sequence diagram by the GUI sending a
	<em>getDetails()</em> message to a <em>specific</em> Member, m</li>
	<li>Note how <em>m:Member</em> is separate to plain <em>Member</em> in
	the sequence diagram, this is to show we are communicating with a
	<em>specific Member</em>,identified by the variable m in the previous
	step</li>

<hr><p>Page 8</p><h1>Further improvement of sequence diagrams</h1>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, the initial design on the sequence diagram can be improved</li>
<li>For instance, in the Add Member use case, the GUI is communicating with 
the DVDLibrary three times: firstly to check if a member exists,
secondly to allocate an ID, and thirdly to create a new member</li>
<li>It would be better if the whole process of adding a member
could be packaged in the DVDLibrary class</li>
<li>That way, the DVDLibrary could perform the whole process of
adding a member without depending on other classes (i.e. the GUI)</li>
<li>...thus making the DVDLibrary more <em>reusable</em> in
other applications</li>
<li>This alternative design, in which a single
<em>addMember()</em> method in DVDLibrary manages the whole
process, is shown below</li>
<li>So in summary, <em>do not blindly adopt the first design you
make in the sequence diagram! Look again at the sequence diagram
and see if your design can be improved!</em></li>

<hr><p>Page 9</p><h1>Sequence diagram with DateValidator class</h1>
<ul>
<li>Remember last week it was mentioned that when 
drawing up robustness diagrams, we can sometimes work out new classes to
add to the domain model</li>
<li>For example, we might decide to add a DateValidator class to be 
responsible for validating the date
	<ul>
	<li>Validating a date is a relatively tricky process, and any relatively
	tricky, involved processes typically have their own class to handle them
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>The version of the sequence diagram below includes a DateValidator class:
the GUI sends it a message when validating the date</li>
</ul>

<hr><p>Page 10</p><h1>Class diagrams - revision</h1>

<ul>
<li>The final stage before coding</li>
<li>Class diagrams show the classes in the system,
their inter-relationships, and the attributes and methods of each class</li>
</ul>

<hr><p>Page 11</p><h1>How to derive the class diagram</h1>
<ul>
<li>Classes and their interrelationships come from the domain model, which
may have had classes added to it at the robustness diagram stage</li>
<li>Attributes are typically added at the robustness stage, by analysing the
robustness diagram and use case texts to figure out possible attributes for
each class (largely common-sense!)</li>
<li>Methods are identified when doing the sequence diagrams</li>
<li>So having done robustness and sequence diagrams, you should have enough
information to complete a class diagram</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 12</p><h1>Class diagram syntax</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>+</em> : public - accessible from anywhere</li>
<li><em>-</em> : private - accessible only from instances of the current
class</li>
<li><em>#</em> : protected - accessible from instances of both the current
class and subclasses</li>
<li>Parameter and return types are also shown</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 13</p><h1>Class diagram example</h1>
<p><img src="../images/classdiagram.png" alt="DVD library class diagram"></p>
<ul>
<li>This class diagram is derived from the two sequence diagrams 
above, by adding the methods from the sequence diagram to the domain
model classes</li>
<li>In Member, <em>- id: int</em> means that id is a private attribute of
the Member class, of type int</li>
<li>In DVDLibrary, <em>+ checkMemberExists(name:String, addr:String):boolean</em> 
means that checkMemberExists is a public method and takes two
Strings (name and address) as parameters, and returns boolean (true/false)
according to whether the member exists or not</li> 
<li>In DVDLibrary, <em>+ findMember(id: int): Member</em> means 
that findMember is a public method and an int parameter, representing the
member ID, and <em>returns</em> a Member</li> 
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 14</p><h1>Converting to code</h1>
<ul>
<li>We can easily convert our class diagram to code, as the class diagram is a 
specification of the attributes and methods of each class</li>
<li>We can also use the <em>sequence</em> diagrams to help us write code
	<ul>
	<li>Sequence diagrams show the sequence in which code is called, so they help us
	write our methods in the correct order</li>
	<li>The order of method calls in the sequence diagram is the order that they
	get called in code</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
