</ul>
<hr><p>Page 2</p><h1>What is Analysis and Design?</h1>
<ul>
<li>We first <em>analyse</em> the problem by breaking it down to get an
idea of such things as:
    <ul>
    <li>How a user will interact with the system</li>
    <li>How the system will respond</li>
    <li>How the system will react to errors</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>From the analysis, we then <em>design</em> the classes in our system by
working out their attributes and methods and how they interact</li> 
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 3</p><h1>UML: Unified Modelling Language</h1>
<ul>
<li>A set of diagrammatic tools to enable developers to
analyse a problem and design an object-oriented solution to the problem 
before coding it</li>
<li>These diagrammatic tools include (but are not restricted to):
    <ul>
    <li>Class diagrams</li>
    <li>Sequence diagrams</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>UML is <em>not</em> an analysis and design process; rather it is a set of
tools which can aid us in that process</li>
<li>It can be used in various different analysis and design techniques</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 4</p><h1>The ICONIX process</h1>
<ul>
<li>A formal method to move from an initial description of a problem
to code</li>
<li>Uses <em>certain</em> (but not all) features of UML</li>
<li>
<img src="../images/iconix.png" alt="The ICONIX process">
</li>
<li>Ref: Rosenberg/Scott</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 5</p><h1>The ICONIX process - the static and dynamic model</h1>
<ul>
<li>We move from the problem statement to code by looking at the analysis and
design from <em>two angles</em>:
	<ul>
	<li>The <em>static model</em> looks at the classes in the system and their
	attributes</li>
	<li>The <em>dynamic model</em> considers things from the point of view of 
	<em>user interaction</em> with the application</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>We develop both in parallel; information from the dynamic model can be
used to develop the static model</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 6</p><h1>The problem statement</h1>
<ul>
<li>The ICONIX process starts with a <em>problem statement</em>
</li>
<li>This is a written description of what is required of the application</li>
<li>Example problem statement:
<pre> There is a requirement for a software application to allow a DVD shop to manage
its stock and handle rentals. Each member is identified by 
member ID. When members join, the DVD shop needs a record of their
name, address and date of birth. Members can rent out up to 5 DVDs and return
them, and may wish to later cancel their membership or inform the 
DVD shop of changes to their details. </pre>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 7</p><h1>What do we do with the problem statement?</h1>
<ul>
<li>We need to derive two artefacts from it (see diagram above):
    <ol>
    <li>The <em>domain model</em> - the initial static model</li>
    <li>The <em>use case diagram</em> - the initial dynamic model</li>
    </ol>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 8</p><h1>1. The domain model</h1>
<ul>
<li>A diagram showing possible classes in the system, and their interaction</li>
<li>We derive it by:
    <ol>
    <li> <em>analysing the problem statement</em>, and looking for
    <em>nouns</em> and their interactions - these are our first guess at
    classes in the system</li>
    <li>Having derived a list of possible objects, we then connect them 
    together to illustrate the <em>relationship between them</em></li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>e.g. for the DVD library application, specified in the problem statement
above:<img src="../images/domainmodel1.png" alt="Initial domain model -  DVD Library">
</li>
<li>This shows three possible classes in the system, and the relationship
between them (DVDLibrary contains DVDs, Member rents DVDs etc)</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 9</p><h1>Multiplicity</h1>
<ul>
<li>Having drawn an initial domain model, we annotate it further with the
<em>multiplicity</em></li>
<li>This shows <em>how many objects</em> of each class are interacting
with each other</li>
<li>e.g. in the DVD library:
<img src="../images/domainmodel2.png" alt="Initial domain model -  DVD Library; multiplicity shown ">
</li>
<li>This diagram is indicating that:
    <ul>
    <li>A DVDLibrary may contain one or more (1...n) DVDs</li>
    <li>A DVDLibrary may contain one or more (1...n) Members</li>
    <li>A Member may rent zero to five (0...5) DVDs</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 10</p><h1>2. The use case diagram</h1>
<ul>
<li>The other initial analysis and design artefact is the <em>use case
diagram</em></li>
<li>This takes a different approach to the problem compared to the
domain model:
    <ul>
    <li>The domain model looks at the problem from the point of view of the
    <em>classes in the system</em> (data driven)</li>
    <li>The use case diagram considers things from the perspective of the
    <em>users</em> (Who are the users? How are they able to interact with the
    system?)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 11</p><h1>A use case diagram</h1>
<p>A use case diagram shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>actor(s)</em>
    <ul>
    <li>These will be the people using the system, e.g. DVD shop staff</li>
    <li>Represented by matchstick figures</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>The <em>use cases</em> themselves
    <ul>
    <li>These are the <em>tasks</em> which the actors need to perform with
    the system</li>
    <li>e.g. for the DVD rental application, these could be:
        <ul>
        <li>Add member</li>
        <li>View member details</li>
        <li>etc. (see below)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../images/BasicUseCase.png" alt="A use-case diagram"></p>
<hr><p>Page 12</p><h1>Including other use cases</h1>
<ul>
<li>A use case can also <em>include</em> another</li>
<li>If a use case includes another, it means that the
included use case <em>must</em> be executed as part of the original use case</li>
<li>An example would be a <em>login</em> use case which is included by many others, eg:
<br>
<img src="../images/Include.png" alt="Use case diagram showing include">
</li>
<li>Here, the <em>add member</em>, <em>rent DVD</em>, <em>return DVD</em>,
<em>delete member</em> and <em>add DVD</em> use cases all include the <em>login</em> use case</li>

<li>According to Booch, Rumbaugh and Jacobson ("The Unified Modeling Language, User Guide" 1999, p227),
the included use case "never stands alone" - it is intended to be executed as part of another
use case</li>

<li>In our login example, this applies: a user never logs in just for the sake of doing it, but
in order to do something else</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 13</p><h1>Including other use cases - example 2</h1>
<ul>
<li>Another example of the use of <em>include</em> is shown below</li>
<li>In this example, <em>rent DVD</em>, <em>return DVD</em>, <em>view member details</em> and
<em>delete member</em> all include the <em>search for member by ID</em> use case</li>
<li>This means that all those use cases must include the search
process as well as their own specific behaviour

<br>
<img src="../images/IncludeSearchMember.png" alt="Use case diagram showing include - Example 2">
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 14</p><h1>Extending other use cases</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Extending</em> a use case means to specify <em>optional additional behaviour</em> which
applies in <em>some cases only</em></li>
<li>extend differs from include: extend indicates an optional extension</li>
<li>Imagine there is an application to manage library 
membership</li>
<li>In the example below, <em>borrow a book</em> 
is an extension of <em>join the library</em></li>
<li>Why is this? 
	<ul>
	<li>When a person borrows a book, they have to be a member of the
	library first</li>
	<li>So "join the library" is an optional extension to 
	"borrow a book"
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Example:
<br>
<img src="../images/library_extend.png" alt="Use case diagram showing extend">
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 15</p><h1>Generalised and specialised actors</h1>
<ul>
<li>A use-case diagram can have more than one actor, as different use cases might be performed
by different actors</li>
<li>Through use of the <em>generalisation</em> symbol in UML (an arrow with an unfilled arrow-head),
we can distinguish between <em>generalised</em> actors and more <em>specialised</em> actors</li>
<li>An example would be a DVD shop manager, which is a more specialised (more specific) type
of DVD shop staff</li>
<li>The example below shows this:
	<ul>
	<li>The DVD shop manager is a more specialised version of a DVD shop staff, so conversely, the
	DVD shop staff is a more generalised version of a manager. We indicate this generalisation
	relationship with an unfilled arrow</li>
	<li>Because the DVD shop manager is a type of DVD shop staff, the manager can do all the use cases that
	an ordinary member of staff can do, plus add a new member of staff</li>
	</ul>
<br>
<img src="../images/SpecialisedActor.png" alt="Use case diagram showing specialised actor">
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 16</p><h1>Use-case texts</h1>
<ul>
<li>The next step is to break down each use case into a series of steps
describing how a user will interact with the system in order to complete the
use case</li>
<li>A use-case text has two columns:
    <ul>
    <li><em>Actor action</em>, describing how the actor will interact with
    the system</li>
    <li><em>System response</em>, describing how the system will respond.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 17</p><h1>Example use-case text: Add member</h1>

<hr><p>Page 18</p><h1>Alternative courses of action</h1>
<ul>
<li>Our use-case text must also include <em>alternative courses of action</em>
</li>
<li>These describe how the system should react to <em>errors</em></li>
<li>This can help us design robust systems</li>
<li>They go below the main use-case text</li>
<li>e.g. in the previous use-case text:
<pre>At step 4: Date of birth is not sensible.
    Staff informed that date of birth is not sensible.
    Staff re-prompted for details (go back to step 3)

At step 5: Member already exists.
    Staff informed that member already exists.
    Return to main menu (go back to step 1)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
