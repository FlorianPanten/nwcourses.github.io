<hr><p>Page 2</p><h1>Bridging the gap between Analysis and Design</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use case texts analyse the application from a user interaction point
of view</li>
<li>We can also bring in classes from the domain model in a more detailed
use case text</li>
<li>However they still do not quite contain enough information to move
to full design of the system
	<ul>
	<li>This is because they are orientated towards user-system interaction,
	not design of code constructs such as classes and objects, methods and
	attributes</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 3</p><h1>Robustness Diagrams</h1>
<ul>
<li>An alternative, graphical way to depict the use cases</li>
<li>Helps you think about how the steps of the use case will interact with
the domain model classes</li>
<li>It also enables you to discover new classes in the system</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 4</p><h1>Robustness Diagram Notation</h1>
<p><img src="../images/robustness2.png" alt="Robustness Diagram Notation"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Boundary Objects</em>: Represent interaction between the user and
the system, e.g. GUI elements, web forms</li>
<li><em>Entity Objects</em>: Represent classes within the system, e.g.
DVDLibrary or Member</li>
<li><em>Controllers</em>: Represent system actions within the program </li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 5</p><h1>Robustness Diagram Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Boundary objects</em> can only talk to controllers</li>
<li><em>Entity objects</em> can only talk to controllers</li>
<li><em>Controllers</em> can talk to boundary objects, entity objects and
other controllers</li>

<p>See use case text below for reference</p>
<hr><p>Page 8</p><h1>Add Member - Controller/Entity Object Interactions</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Check member doesn't exist already</em> interacts with
DVDLibrary
	<ul>
	<li>This controller needs a list of all the members</li>
	<li>So, it needs to interact with some sort of class which contains a 
	list of all the members</li>
	<li>A "manager" class, e.g. the DVDLibrary, fits the bill here
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Create member</em> interacts with Member
	<ul>
	<li>... because it has to create a new Member object!</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Allocate ID</em> interacts with DVDLibrary
	<ul>
	<li>To allocate a new ID, we need to have a record of all existing IDs</li>
	<li>Again, a manager class which has a record of all members fits the bill
	here</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Add member to DVD library</em> interacts with DVDLibrary
	<ul>
	<li>...as we need to add the new member to the DVD library!</li>

<h2>DVD Library: View Member</h2>
<p><img src="../images/robustness3.png" alt="Robustness Diagram: DVD Library: View Member"></p>
<p>See use case text below for reference</p>
<hr><p>Page 11</p><h1>View Member: Controller/Entity Object Interactions</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Search for member</em> needs to interact with DVDLibrary
	<ul>
	<li>A search for a member needs to go through a list of existing 
	members... so again a class to manage members fits the bill here</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Retrieve member details</em> needs to interact with Member
	<ul>
	<li>Once Search (the previous controller) has found a member, we then
	need to query the member to find its details</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 12</p><h1>How to Create a Robustness Diagram</h1>
<ul>
<li>Go through your use-case text one step at a time</li>
<li>Each system response in the use-case text typically becomes a controller
in the robustness diagram</li>
<li>For each controller, you need to <em>consider what entity objects might
be required</em> to carry out that action</li>
<li>These may be entity objects from the domain model, but you may also
discover <em>new entity objects</em> by performing the robustness analysis</li>
<li>Thus, one of the effects of robustness analysis is to increase the number
of objects in the domain model</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 13</p><h1>Discovering Attributes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Robustness diagrams also allow us to <em>discover attributes</em> which
we can add to the classes in the domain model</li>
<li>For example, in the robustness diagram above, we can figure out that
a DVDLibrary needs to contain a collection of Members</li>
<li>... or that Member needs name, date of birth and address as attributes</li>
<li>A frequent way to do this is by considering what the user needs to enter in
the boundary objects and "tracing back " the information to the
appropriate entity object  
(Rosenberg/Scott, Applying Use-Case Driven Object Modelling with UML, p82)
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 14</p><h1>Summary of the Aims of Robustness Diagrams</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Discovery of new domain model classes</em>. We can discover further
classes by thinking about what sort of classes each controller needs to talk 
to. 
	<ul>
	<li>For example, in the "add member" use case, we could decide that a
	<em>DateValidator</em> class is necessary to check the date of
	birth</li>
	<li>Checking the date of birth is a relatively complex process
	(differing month lengths, leap years etc) so it might make sense to put
	it in its own class</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Discovery of attributes to add to the domain model</em></li>
<li><em>Clarification of the role of existing domain model classes</em>. By 
writing the use 
case text in an alternative, graphical form, we can clarify the interaction
between domain classes and user/system actions - 
<em>this can help us draw up methods in the next stage</em></li>
<li><em>Provides a check on use cases</em> Drawing use cases in an
alternative graphical form can check that the use case text is sensible and
we have not missed anything out - particularly alternative courses. 
Frequently robustness diagrams allow us to
think of other alternative courses which we missed out earlier.</li>
</ul>
<p>(derived in part
from Rosenberg/Scott, "Applying Use-Case Driven Object Modelling
with UML", page 61)</p>
<hr><p>Page 15</p><h1>Updating Use Case Texts</h1>
<ul>
<li>We have already seen that robustness analysis can help us add more detail
to the domain model</li>
<li>We can also use it to <em>add more detail to the use case text</em></li>
<li>New steps, or new alternative courses discovered through robustness
analysis should be added to the corresponding use-case text</li>
<li>We also reference the domain model objects through the use-case text,
not just the user-system interaction</li>
<li>This gives us the <em>design-level use case text</em></li>
<li>Sometimes this is also done before the robustness
diagram (the use-case is rewritten referencing objects from the domain model)
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 16</p><h1>Robustness diagrams are throwaway, use case texts are not!</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Robustness analysis is a "throwaway" technique to make
the move from analysis to design easier, but the robustness diagrams are not
kept</em></li>
<li>By contrast, use case texts must be kept as they are part of the primary
analysis and design 
documentation and needed for reference</li>
<li>If we perform further analysis and design iterations, we will need to
update the use case texts again later</li>
</ul>
