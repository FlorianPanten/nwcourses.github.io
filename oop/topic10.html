<h1>Topic 10: Inheritance</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<em>Inheritance</em> allows us to use an existing class as a basis for a new,
related class.
Imagine we wanted to write classes representing different types of
vehicle, e.g. Car, Bus, Motorbike. If we were to write the three classes entirely 
separately, we'd be <em>repeating</em> a
good deal of code - e.g. the code for starting and stopping the engine is common to all three
classes.</p>
<p>So what we could do in this case is create a <em>Vehicle</em> class,
containing common functionality for all types of vehicle, and then
<em>inherit</em> various <em>subclasses</em> of Vehicle (such as Car, Bus, and
Motorbike) which provide additional functionality specific to that type
of Vehicle. We can say that:
    <ul>
    <li>The Car <em>inherits</em> from or  is a <em>subclass</em> of Vehicle</li>
    <li>Vehicle is a <em>superclass</em> of Car</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>How is inheritance achieved in Java?</h2>
<p>In Java, we use the keyword <em>extends</em>, e.g.
<pre>
public class Car extends Vehicle
{
.... Car attributes and methods
}
</pre>
This means that the <em>Car</em> class inherits from Vehicle. All attributes and methods in Vehicle
will be <em>inherited</em> by Car, so when you create a Car, all the Vehicle methods and attributes
will be available.</p>

<h3>Java Inheritance Example</h3>

<p>Below is a <em>Vehicle</em> superclass with <em>Bike</em> and <em>Car</em>
subclasses.</p>
<h4>Vehicle class (Vehicle.java):</h4>
<pre>
<em>// Generic Vehicle superclass</em>
public class Vehicle 
{
    <em>// Attributes common to all vehicles</em>
    protected int topSpeed, nWheels; 
    protected String make;

    public Vehicle (String makeIn, int topSpeedIn, int nWheelsIn)
    {
        this.make=makeIn;
        this.topSpeed=topSpeedIn;
        this.nWheels=nWheelsIn;
    }

    public void move()
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;Moving along...&quot;);
    }

    public void print()
    {
        System.out.println( &quot;Make : &quot; + make + &quot;\nTop speed: &quot; + 
            topSpeed + &quot;\nno. wheels: &quot; + nWheels);
    }
}
</pre>
<h4>Car class (Car.java):</h4>
<pre>
public class Car extends Vehicle 
{
    <em>// Car-specific data</em>
    private int engineCapacity; 
    private boolean engineRunning;

    public Car(String makeIn, int topSpeedIn, int engineCapacityIn)
    {
        <em>// Call the superclass (Vehicle) constructor to construct the Vehicle </em>
        <em>// component of the Car. We will pass in the top speed, make, and</em>
        <em>// number of wheels (which we know will be 4)</em>
        super(makeIn, topSpeedIn, 4);

        <em>// Set up the Car-specific attributes (engine capacity)</em>
        this.engineCapacity = engineCapacityIn;
    }

    <em>// Overridden move() for cars</em>
    public void move()
    {
        if (engineRunning)
        {
            System.out.println(&quot;Driving along...&quot;);
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println
                (&quot;Can't drive the car if the engine's stopped!!!&quot;);
        }
    }

    <em>// Car-specific methods</em>
    public void start()
    {
        engineRunning=true;
    }

    public void stop()
    {
        engineRunning = false;
    }

    <em>// Convert the car to a String. Note the use of super.toString() to</em>
    <em>// call the superclass (Vehicle) version of toString() to get the</em>
    <em>// make, top speed and number of wheels.</em>
    public void print()
    {
        super.print();
        System.out.println(&quot; Engine running? 
                    &quot; + engineRunning + &quot;\nEngine capacity: &quot; +
                            engineCapacity);
    }
}
</pre>
<h4>Bike class (Bike.java):</h4>
<pre>
public class Bike extends Vehicle 
{
    <em>// Bike-specific data</em>
    private boolean isOffRoad;
    private int nGears; 

    public Bike(String makeIn,int topSpeedIn,boolean isOffRoadIn,int nGearsIn)
    {
        <em>//Call the superclass (Vehicle) constructor to construct the Vehicle</em>
        <em>// component of the Bike. We will pass in the top speed, make, and</em>
        <em>// number of wheels (which we know will be 2)</em>
        super(makeIn,topSpeedIn,2);

        <em>// Set up the Bike-specific attributes (off-road status and gears)</em>
        this.isOffRoad = isOffRoadIn;
        this.nGears = nGearsIn;
    }

    public void print()
    {
       super.print();
       System.out.println(&quot; Off road? &quot; + 
                            isOffRoad + &quot;\nNo. Gears: &quot; +
                            nGears);
    }
}

public class InheritanceTestApp 
{
    public static void main (String args[])
    {
        Car c= new Car(&quot;Ford&quot;,120,2000);
        Bike b = new Bike(&quot;Raleigh&quot;,30,true,27);

        c.print();
        b.print();

        c.move();
        c.start();
        c.move();
        c.stop();

        b.move();
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>How is this working?
    <ul>
    <li>First, note that in the <em>Vehicle</em> class the attributes are not private,
    but <em>protected</em>. <em>protected</em> means that attributes are accessible from
    <em>subclasses</em> (e.g. Car, Bike) whereas <em>private</em> indicates that, while the attributes
    are still there in memory, they are hidden from the subclasses and cannot be used from them.</li>
    <li>Note how the constructor for Car calls the Vehicle constructor 
    to initialise the Vehicle aspects of the Car. This is done with the line
    <pre>super(make, topSpeed, 4)</pre>
    The <em>super</em> keyword represents the <em>super</em>class. When used in this way, it means
    "call the superclass constructor". So when the Car constructor is called, it in turn calls the
    Vehicle constructor to initialise the Vehicle aspects of the car (make, top speed, and number of 
    wheels). The Vehicle constructor will initialise the corresponding attributes to the values
	passed to <em>super()</em>: because we always pass 4 for the number of wheels, the
	<em>nWheels</em> attribute will always be initialised to 4 for Cars.</li>
	<li>We do something similar in Bike, but in this case, we always pass 2 for the number of wheels.</li>
    <li>Notice also how we call the superclass version of print() in the
    subclass version using <em>super.print()</em></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Overriding Methods</h3>
<p>In the example, Vehicle and Car both have a method called 
<em>move()</em>. We have 
<em>overridden</em> the original version in Vehicle with the version in Car -
in other words, replaced the original Vehicle version of move() with a new 
version in Car.
This will mean that:
    <ul>
    <li>If we call <em>move()</em> on a Vehicle, then the Vehicle 
    <em>move()</em> will be called;</li>
    <li>If we call <em>move()</em> on a Car, then the Car <em>move()</em> 
    will be called;</li>
    <li>If we call <em>move()</em> on a Bike, then the Vehicle <em>move()</em> 
    will be called, because we did not override it in Bike</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>In the same way, <em>print()</em> is overridden in both Car and Bike. However, unlike for 
<em>move()</em>, the overridden version of <em>print()</em> calls the original, Vehicle version of
<em>print()</em> using the super keyword: <em>super.print();</em>.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<h3>Basic inheritance exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a class <em>LibraryItem</em>, representing an item that a library might lend out, such as a book, a DVD or a CD.
Give your LibraryItem class a title attribute, representing the LibraryItem's title. It should also have a getDescription() method. This should just return the title.
It should also have a suitable constructor.
</li>
<li>Inherit Book, DVD and CD from LibraryItem. Each subclass should have additional attributes representing the specific data associated with that subclass: author for 
Book; certificate and lead actor for DVD; and artist for CD. Also give each class a series of "getter" (accessor) methods to return each attribute, and give each class a 
suitable constructor. Use <em>super</em> appropriately.</li>
<li>Give each class a getDescription() method of its own. This should return the full details as a string, e.g. a string containing film name, certificate and lead actor for 
the DVD. Use <em>super</em> appropriately.</li>
<li>Test out your system with a main().</li>
</ol>
<h3>Inheritance in your chase game</h3>
<p>Return to your chase game from
<a href="topic7.html">topic 7</a>. Create a new class, <em>Creature</em>, that contains all
the attributes and methods common to both Hero and Monster. Make Hero and Monster inherit from 
Creature. Rewrite the game to use the inheritance hierarchy.</p>
