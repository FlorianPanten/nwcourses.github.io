<h1> Topic 3: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Java</h1>

<h2>What is object-oriented programming?</h2>

<p>So far, you have met <em>procedural</em> programming. Procedural programming involves
statements sequentially executing one after the other, with common tasks (such as, for example,
calculating the cube of a number or printing a character a certain number of times) placed in
<em>functions</em>.</p>

<p>However, once programs become larger, our programs can become harder to read and maintain, even if we
use functions to accomplish common tasks. Therefore, another approach is needed and this is where
<em>object-oriented programming</em> comes in. Object-oriented programming involves creating code to
represent <em>real world entities</em>, such as cats, employees, students or graphical user interface
elements. An object-oriented program will then contain several <em>objects</em> - code representations of
these real-world entities - all communicating with each other.</p>

<h2>Classes and Objects</h2>

<p>When doing object-oriented programming, we need to distinguish between <em>classes</em> and
<em>objects</em>. What is the difference between a class and an object?
    <ul>
    <li>A <em>class</em> is a specification or a blueprint for how a real-world entity, such as a cat, an
    employee, a student or a GUI element operates. It is not a <em>specific</em> entity, but something which
    describes how <em>all</em> entities of that type work. Examples of classes would be <em>Cat</em>,
    <em>Employee</em>, <em>Student</em> or <em>Button</em> (as in clickable button on a GUI).</li>
    <li>An <em>object</em> is a <em>specific example</em> of a class. We say that <em>objects</em>
    are <em>members of a particular class</em>. For example: 
        <ul>
        <li>Tom, Tigger and Felix might
        be individual examples of the Cat class, or Cat <em>objects</em></li>
        <li>Madonna and Michael Jackson might be <em>objects</em> of the Popstar 
        class.</li>
        <li>Russell Crowe and Tom Cruise might be <em>objects</em> of the Actor class. </li>
        <li>Barack Obama might be an <em>object</em> of the Politician class.</li>
        <li>The four ghosts in a Pacman game might each be <em>objects</em> of the <em>Ghost</em> class.</li>
        </ul>
    and so on.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Attributes and methods</h3>

<p>Classes contain two components: <em>attributes</em> and <em>methods</em>.
<ul>
<li> An <em>attribute</em> is something
which <em>describes</em> objects of that class. For example:
    <ul>a Cat class might contain attributes for name,
    age, weight, breed, and so on.</li>
    <li>An Employee class might contain attributes for name, job title and salary.</li>
    <li>and a Student class might contain attributes for name, course, and mark.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>A <em>method</em> is an <em>action</em> or <em>something that objects of the class can
do</em>. For example:
    <ul>
    <li>a Cat class might have <em>walk</em>, <em>eat</em> and <em>meow</em>
    methods.</li>
    <li>a Car class might have <em>start</em>, <em>drive</em> and <em>stop</em> methods.</li>
    <li>The Pacman in a Pacman game might have <em>move</em>, <em>eatPill</em> and <em>eatPowerPill</em>
        methods</li>
    <li>And the Ghost class (representing ghosts in a Pacman game) might have <em>chase</em>
    and <em>retreat</em> methods (the latter when the Pacman has eaten a power pill).</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<h3>A Cat class</h3>
<p>Here is an example of a Java class representing a Cat:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk()
    {
        this.weight--;
    }

    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
}
</pre>
So what does this code mean?
<pre>public class Cat</pre>
This line states that we are creating a class called <em>Cat</em>. Remember that a class is a <em>blueprint</em>
or <em>specification</em> for all objects of that type. So the class will not actually create an 
individual, specific Cat, but instead, describes what Cats are and how they operate.</p>

<p>
<pre>private String name;</pre>
This line is defining an <em>attribute</em> called <em>name</em>. The line is saying that each Cat object
created using this class will have their own <em>name</em> attribute, representing their name. 
We will come on to the meaning of the keyword <em>private</em> a bit later.
</p>
<p>
<pre>private int age, weight;</pre>
This line does the same for the age and the weight, which are both integers.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
{
    this.name = nameIn;
    this.age = ageIn;
    this.weight = weightIn;
}
</pre>
This piece of code is called a <strong>CONSTRUCTOR</strong>. A <em>constructor</em> is a special 
<em>method</em> (see above)
which is used to <em>initialise</em> objects of the current class. <em>A constructor has the same name as the 
class</em>, so this one is called "<em>Cat</em>". (We will see the meaning of <em>public</em> later).
When we create an object (and you will see how to do this below) the <em>constructor is called</em>.
This constructor takes three parameters from outside the class
(<em>nameIn</em>, <em>ageIn</em> and <em>weightIn</em>) and <em>sets the attributes to the parameters
passed in</em>. Note the difference between attributes and parameters:
    <ul>
    <li>Parameters represent the information <em>coming in</em> from outside, such as from the main().
    This is why I have named them name<em>In</em>, etc. You can think of them as <em>temporary</em>: a
    parameter is just there to get the information into objects of the class from outside.</li>
    <li>Attributes are <em>contained within the class</em>. Once an object of the class is created,
    it contains a series of attributes which are <em>permanent</em>: they last until the object is
    destroyed.</li>
    </ul>
Note also the use of the keyword <em>this</em> to represent the attributes. <em>this</em> represents 
<em>the current object we are working with</em>. So the code will set the attributes of whichever object
we're initialising to the parameters passed in.</p>
<p>(<em>this</em> is actually optional here, but I have included it for clarity).</p>
<p>
<pre>    
public void walk()
{
    this.weight--;
}
</pre>
This is a <em>method</em>, which, as we saw above, is an <em>action</em> or something that 
objects of a class can <em>do</em>. The method is called <em>walk()</em>. The effect of this method is
to walk a cat by reducing the cat's weight (<em>this.weight</em>) by one.
This type of code probably looks familiar to you from Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving as a
<em>function</em>. However, it is a bit different to a normal function. It lives inside our <em>class</em>
(i.e. the Cat class). This basically means that it will <em>operate on objects belonging to the
Cat class</em>. So, a method can be defined as a function which belongs to a class.</p>
<p>
<pre>public void display()
{
    System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight)
}</pre>
This code defines another method called <em>display()</em> which displays the details of the cat.</p>

<h3>Creating objects of the Cat class</h3>
<p>I cannot emphasise strongly enough that the above code <em>does not actually create any specific Cat
objects</em>. It merely <em>defines a Cat class, which is a blueprint or specification for what Cats are and
what they do.</em> We need, in addition, to create <em>specific Cat objects</em> in our <em>main()</em> (or
elsewhere outside the Cat class). Here is a <em>main()</em> which creates two Cat objects and does things with
them:
<pre>
public class CatApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat tom = new Cat ("Tom", 5, 15);
        Cat tigger =new Cat ("Tigger", 10, 5);
        
        tom.display();
        tigger.display();
        
        tom.walk();
        tigger.walk();
        
        tom.display();
        tigger.display();
        
        tom.walk();
        tom.display();
    }
}
</pre>
How is this code working?
<pre>Cat tom = new Cat ("Tom", 5, 15);
Cat tigger =new Cat ("Tigger", 10, 5);</pre>
These two lines create <em>two specific Cat objects</em>, <em>tom</em> and <em>tigger</em>. Note the keyword
<em>new</em>. This means that we are creating a <em>new</em> object of the specified class (<em>Cat</em> here).
Note also how we <em>pass into the object</em> three pieces of information: the <em>name</em> (e.g.
"Tom"), the <em>age</em> (e.g. 5), and the <em>weight</em> (e.g. 15). These three pieces of information
become the <em>parameters</em> in the constructor. So if we revisit the constructor:
<pre>
public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
{
    this.name = nameIn;
    this.age = ageIn;
    this.weight = weightIn;
}    
</pre>
When we create our first Cat,
<em>nameIn</em> takes the value "Tom", <em>ageIn</em> takes the value 5, and <em>weightIn</em> takes the
value 15. Since the constructor then sets the attributes to these three parameters, the 
<em>name</em>, <em>age</em> and <em>weight</em> attributes of the object <em>tom</em> will be "Tom", 5, and
15 respectively. So when we display the object <em>tom</em>:
<pre>tom.display();</pre>
then the <em>display()</em> method will be called, which, if you remember, is as follows:
<pre>public void display()
{
    System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight)
}</pre>
Since the <em>display()</em> method displays the name, age and weight attributes, which we set in the
constructor, the <em>display()</em> method will output:
<pre>Name: Tom Age: 5 Weight: 15</pre>
</p>
<p>
Likewise for the second cat, we will set up a cat with a <em>name</em> attribute of "Tigger", an
<em>age</em> attribute of 10 and a <em>weight</em> attribute of 15, so that when we display Tigger we end up
with:
<pre>Name: Tigger Age: 10 Weight 5</pre>
</p>
<p>Having displayed the cats, we then <em>walk()</em> them:
<pre>tom.walk();
tigger.walk();
</pre>
These two lines will call the <em>walk()</em> method on <em>tom</em> and <em>tigger</em>. Since the effect of
the <em>walk()</em> method is to reduce the <em>weight</em> attribute of the current cat by one, when we
<em>display()</em> the two cats again, their weight will be reduced by one. We then <em>walk()</em> Tom again
so Tom's weight will be reduced by a further unit. </p>
<p>So the overall output of the program will be:
<pre>
Name: Tom Age: 5 Weight: 15
Name: Tigger Age: 10 Weight 5
Name: Tom Age: 5 Weight: 14
Name: Tigger Age: 10 Weight 4
Name: Tom Age: 5 Weight: 13
</pre>
</p>


<h2>Exercise</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add an additional method called <em>eat()</em> to the Cat class. The <em>eat()</em> method should add one
to the weight of the cat.</li>
<li>Create a new <em>main()</em> with two Cats with these attributes:
<pre>Name: Felix Age:2 Weight:7
Name: Sylvester Age:7 Weight:10</pre>
Make Felix eat twice, and display Felix's details. Make Sylvester walk four times, and display Sylvester's details.
</li>
<li>Create a completely new class called <em>Hero</em> to represent a hero in a 2D game. Give it the following
attributes:
	<ul>
	<li><em>name</em>, representing the character's name.</li>
	<li><em>score</em>, representing the Hero's score.</li>
	<li><em>lives</em>, the number of remaining lives.</li>
	</ul>
Also give it the following methods.
	<ul>
	<li>A constructor, which initialises the hero's name and lives. The score should always be initialised
	to 0.</li>
	<li><em>loseLife()</em> should reduce the hero's lives by one.</li>
	<li><em>increaseScore()</em> should increase the hero's score by 10 points.</li>
	<li><em>printDetails()</em> should print the details of the hero (name, score and lives).
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a main() which creates a Hero object, calls the methods a few times, and prints the hero's
details after each method to prove that the Hero's properties have changed. (Later on, you will actually create a simple chase game making use of this Hero class!)</li>
</ol>
