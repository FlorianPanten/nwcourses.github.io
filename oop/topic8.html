<h1>Topic 8: ArrayLists</h1>

<p>In Topic 6 we covered <em>arrays</em>. We saw that an array was a variable which could be used to
hold more than one item. However, there is a problem with the use of arrays. We have to give them
a <em>fixed capacity</em> (<em>capacity</em>=number of members the array will hold)
which cannot change. For example, this program (there is also an Employee
class, but this is not shown) will read in employee 
records from the keyboard, but the array has a fixed initial size of 10 which cannot be changed:
<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FixedArraysApp1
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Employee[] employees = new Employee[10];
        String name, jobTitle;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        for(int count=0; count&lt;10; count++)
        {
            System.out.println("Enter employee name:");
            name = scanner.nextLine();
            System.out.println("Enter employee job title:");
            jobTitle = scanner.nextLine();

            employees[count] = new Employee( name, jobTitle );
        }

        for(int count=0; count&lt;10</em>; count++)
        {
            employees[count].display();
        }
        
    }
}
</pre>
A slight enhancement of this can be made by specifying a <em>variable</em> for the array capacity
when we create it, e.g.:
<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class FixedArraysApp2
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.println("How many employees");
        String numString = scanner.nextLine();
        int <em>numEmployees</em> = Integer.parseInt(numString);
        
        Employee[] employees = new Employee[<em>numEmployees</em>];
        String name, jobTitle;
        
        
        for(int count=0; count&lt;<em>numEmployees</em>; count++)
        {
            System.out.println("Enter employee name:");
            name = scanner.nextLine();
            System.out.println("Enter employee job title:");
            jobTitle = scanner.nextLine();
        
            Employee e = new Employee( name, jobTitle );
            employees[count] = e;    
        }

        for(int count=0; count&lt;<em>numEmployees</em>; count++)
        {
            employees[count].display();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
In this example, we are reading in the number of employees from the keyboard and creating the array
using this value. This is a bit more flexible than the first example, but still has the problem that
<em>once we have specified an initial size for the array, we cannot change it</em>. If the user enters
20, for example, the array's capacity will be 20, and we will not be able to add more than 20 
employees. But what if the user then realised that there were more than 20?</p>
<h2>Introducing the ArrayList</h2>

<p>This is where the <em>ArrayList</em> can come in useful. An ArrayList is a built-in Java class which
can <em>vary in capacity</em>. We can create an ArrayList and then keep adding objects to it until
the JVM's memory runs out. This makes the ArrayList much more flexible than a plain array.
Here is an example of code which uses an ArrayList:
<pre>
// Product class
public class Product
{
    private String name;
    private double price;
    private int quantityInStock;
    
    public Product (String nameIn, double priceIn, int quantityIn)
    {
        name = nameIn;
        price = priceIn;
        quantityInStock = quantityIn;
    }
    
    public void print()
    {
        System.out.println("Name=" + name + " Price=" + price + " Quantity in stock=" + quantityInStock);
    }
}
</pre>
<pre>
// Main class
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListExample1
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        ArrayList&lt;Product&gt; products = new ArrayList&lt;Product&gt; ();
        
        Product product1 = new Product("Smartphone", 299.99, 5);
        Product product2 = new Product("Tablet", 199.99, 3);
        Product product3 = new Product("SD Card", 9.99, 100);
        
        products.add(product1);
        products.add(product2);
        products.add(product3);
        
        for(int count=0; count&lt;products.size(); count++)
        {
            Product currentProduct = products.get(count);
            currentProduct.print();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<ul>
<li>As an aside, note how I no longer include <em>this</em> when referring to the
attributes of Product. I have included <em>this</em> so far for clarity, to help
distinguish between attributes and parameters, but most real Java programs would not
include it. Now you are (hopefully) used to using attributes, I have now removed
it.</li>
<li>Note how we must <em>import</em> the ArrayList from <em>java.util</em> before we use it:
<pre>import java.util.ArrayList;</pre>
</li>
<li>
The first line in the <em>main()</em> creates the ArrayList:
<pre>ArrayList&lt;Product&gt; products = new ArrayList&lt;Product&gt; ();</pre>
Note that <em>ArrayList</em>s are objects, so we use <em>new</em> to create them, just like any other
object. Note that the data type includes <em>what type of data the ArrayList is holding</em>, so
here the data type is <em>ArrayList&lt;Product&gt;</em> because it is an ArrayList holding Product
objects.
</li>
<li>We then create three Product objects.</li>
<li>We then add the three Product objects to the ArrayList with the <em>add()</em> method of
ArrayList.</li>
<li>We then loop through the ArrayList. The <em>size()</em> method of ArrayList gives us the number of
elements in (members of) the ArrayList.</li>
<li>Inside the loop, we obtain the current Product using the <em>get()</em> method of ArrayList. The
get() method is how we <em>index</em> an ArrayList: 
<pre>Product currentProduct = products.get(count);</pre>
This line is creating a variable called <em>currentProduct</em> and setting it equal to the current
member of the ArrayList.</li>
<li>Finally, we print this Product.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A more efficient version of the above code</h3>

<p>The code above was written in a way to try and make it as clear as possible what is going on.
However, we could write the code more efficiently (less lines of code) as follows:
<pre>
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListExample1
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        ArrayList&lt;Product&gt; products = new ArrayList&lt;Product&gt; ();
        
        products.add(new Product("Smartphone", 299.99, 5));
        products.add(new Product("Tablet", 199.99, 3));
        products.add(new Product("SD Card", 9.99, 100));
        
        for(int count=0; count&lt;products.size(); count++)
        {
            products.get(count).print();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
Note how, rather than creating three variables <em>product1</em>, <em>product2</em> and 
<em>product3</em>, we <em>create the product objects and add them to the array list in one 
statement</em>. This is perfectly acceptable as the <em>add()</em> method of the ArrayList is
expecting a <em>Product</em> object as a parameter - and we are giving it one.</p>
<p>Note also how we combine two statements into one in the for loop. Rather than storing the current
member of the ArrayList in a variable called <em>currentProduct</em> and then calling the 
<em>print()</em> method on <em>currentProduct</em>, we call the <em>print()</em> method directly on
the return value of <em>products.get(count)</em>. Since <em>products.get(count)</em> gives us a Product
object, this is, again, acceptable.</p>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create an Employee class with attributes for name and job title,
a constructor which initialises the name and job title, and a 
<em>display()</em> method which displays the employee's details.</li>
<li>Write a program which adds three employees to an ArrayList and loops
through and displays them.</li>
<li>Rewrite the second Employee example above (<em>FixedArraysApp2</em>) so that it uses an ArrayList
rather than a regular array. 
</li>
<li>After reading in the employees from the keyboard, modify the second loop to
display them all, so that it uses ArrayLists.</li>
<li>Modify your code so that, rather than the user entering the number of employees, the program
keeps adding employees until the user enters "quit" for the employee name.</li>
<li>Return to your chase game. Store the three monsters in an ArrayList rather than a regular array.</li>
</ul>
