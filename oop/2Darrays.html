<h1>Extra Material: 2D Arrays</h1>

<p>We have already covered one-dimensional arrays. However, arrays are not restricted to one dimension:
there are many cases in which a <em>2D array</em> would be useful. We can even have multi-dimensional
arrays above 2D: 3D, 4D and so on.</p>

<h2>An example</h2>

<p>Imagine that you are studying a multi-year Java course at an adult education department in a college.
The Java course takes place over three years, and each year has five assessments.
To store the marks for each assessment in code, you could use a <em>2D array</em> with three rows
(one for each year). Each row would itself be an array with five members, representing the individual
mark for each assessment. The diagram below is a simple representation of a 2D array, and shows how
you reference the individual values. <br />
<img src="images/2Darray.png" alt="Simple representation of a 2D array" />
</p>
<p>Here is a program which uses a 2D array to store the marks. The program reads in the marks and then
displays them.</p>

<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TwoDArrayApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int[][] marks = new int[3][5];
        String input;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        <em>//Read in the marks</em>
        for(int i=0; i&lt;marks.length; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Entering marks for year " + i);
            for(int j=0; j&lt;marks[i].length; j++)
            {
                System.out.println("Enter mark for assessment " + j + " for year " + i);
                input = scanner.nextLine();
                
                marks[i][j] = Integer.parseInt (input);
            }
        }
        
        <em>//Display the marks that were read in</em>
        for(int i=0; i&lt;marks.length; i++)
        {
            System.out.print("Marks for year " + i + ": ");
            for(int j=0; j&lt;marks[i].length; j++)
            {
                System.out.print (marks[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.print("\n");
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Note the following:
    <ul>
    <li>The data type of the 2D array is <em>int[][]</em>. This is similar in syntax to a 1D array
    in which the data type is <em>int[]</em> (assuming it's an int array).</li>
    <li>When creating the 2D array, we need to specify the number of rows and columns. So:
    <pre>int[][] marks = new int[3][5];</pre>
    will create a 2D array with 3 rows and 5 columns.</li>
    <li>The 2D array is actually an <em>array of arrays.</em> 
    <em>marks</em> is an array of three integer arrays, one for each year.
    Each row is an integer array with five members, one for each assessment. 
    Generalising this: when we initialise a 2D array with code such as:
    <pre>int[][] array = new int[nrows][ncolumns];</pre>
    then <em>nrows</em>, the number of "rows", is actually the number of 1D arrays within the
    2D array. <em>ncols</em>, the number of "columns", is then the number of elements within
    each 1D array. So a more accurate representation of a 2D array is actually as follows: <br />
	<img src="images/2Darray_2.png" alt="2D array as an array of arrays" /></li>
    <li>Therefore, in this case:
        <ul>
        <li>marks[0] is an array containing the marks for year 1;</li>
        <li>marks[1] is an array containing the marks for year 2;</li>
        <li>marks[2] is an array containing the marks for year 3.</li>
        <li>In the loops, <em>marks[i]</em> is an array representing the current year.
        Remember that we can obtain the capacity of an array, i.e. the maximum number of elements
        that the array will hold, using <em>.length</em>. So, in the inner loop, we are looping
        from 0 up to the number of elements in marks[i], i.e. the number of assessments per year.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
	<li>This is the first time you have seen a <em>loop within a loop</em>. There is an 
	<em>outer</em> loop in which we count from 0 to <em>marks.length</em>
	(why <em>marks.length</em> and not 3?
	It allows us to change the dimensions of the array without having to change the loop, as the loop
	will always count to however many elements are in the array). This outer
	loop goes through each year, the variable <em>i</em> containing the values 0, 1 and 2 in turn.
	Then, <em>each time</em> the outer loop runs, we start an <em>inner</em> loop using the variable
	<em>j</em>. The variable <em>j</em> represents each assessment. We loop from 0 to
	<em>marks[i].length</em> (the length of the array of marks for year <em>i</em>) within the inner loop,
	and read each value into <em>marks[i][j]</em> (i.e. assessment <em>j</em> for year <em>i</em>).</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>2D Arrays with variable-length sub-arrays</h3>

<p>The above example showed a 2D array where all the individual rows (sub-arrays) had the same 
length (5). However, this does not actually need to be the case. We can have 2D arrays with 
<em>variable length rows</em>. Imagine a modified version of the above scenario where in year 1, 
there are only 3 assessments, in year 2 there are 5, and in year 3 there are 7. We could use code
like this:
<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TwoDArrayApp2
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        <em> //Second dimension of the 2D array unspecified</em>
        int[][] marks = new int[3][];
        String input;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        <em>// Initialise the individual rows</em>
        marks[0] = new int[3];
        marks[1] = new int[5];
        marks[2] = new int[7];
        
        <em>//Read in the marks</em>
        for(int i=0; i&lt;marks.length; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Entering marks for year " + i);
            for(int j=0; j&lt;marks[i].length; j++)
            {
                System.out.println("Enter mark for assessment " + j + " for year " + i);
                input = scanner.nextLine();
                
                marks[i][j] = Integer.parseInt (input);
            }
        }
        
        <em>//Display the marks that were read in</em>
        for(int i=0; i&lt;3; i++)
        {
            System.out.print("Marks for year " + i + ": ");
            for(int j=0; j&lt;marks[i].length; j++)
            {
                System.out.print (marks[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.print("\n");
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>In this example, we initialise the 2D array slightly differently:
<pre>int[][] marks = new int[3][];</pre>
Note the missing second dimension, with the empty square brackets <em>[]</em>. 
Rather than creating an array of three arrays, as before, this creates an array of three
<em>null</em> arrays. Each member of <em>marks</em> will contain the value <em>null</em> at this
point. So we have to explicitly create a new array for each member of <em>marks</em>:
<pre>
marks[0] = new int[3];
marks[1] = new int[5];
marks[2] = new int[7];
</pre>
Once we have done that, our loops to read in the marks and display them are exactly as they were before.
Because we are using <em>marks[i].length</em> in the inner loop, rather than a constant value
(e.g. 5), it will count from 0 to whatever the length of the current year's array is (3, 5 or 7).</p>
<p>A diagram of a variable-length 2D array is shown below. <br />

</p>
<h3>Pre-initialising a 2D array</h3>
<p>As for 1D arrays, we can pre-initialise an entire 2D array in one statement, using the braces
syntax. The following example does this with the marks scenario:
<pre>
public class TwoDArrayApp3 
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int[][] marks = 
            {
                { 32, 45, 56 },
                { 67, 78, 78, 56, 81 },
                { 80, 78, 81, 84, 66, 67, 93 }
            };
        
        for(int i=0; i&lt;marks.length; i++)
        {    
            for (int j=0; j&lt;marks[i].length; j++)
            {
                System.out.print(marks[i][j]+" ");            
            }
            System.out.print("\n");
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<ul>
<li>Return to your chase game. Have a go at creating a <em>maze</em> using a 2D array, such as the maze
used in Pacman games. It should be a 2D array of <em>char</em>s. Use any character you like for the
wall (e.g. 'X').
Draw the maze in your <em>render()</em> method by using an outer loop for rows
and an inner loop for columns, using <em>fillRect()</em>
to draw a block of, say, 32x32 in a given colour at the appropriate
position on screen when an 'X' is encountered in your array.</li>
<li>If you really want a challenge, modify the movement of the player and the monsters so that they cannot
move through walls! Then, you are halfway to writing your own Pacman game!</li>
</ul>
