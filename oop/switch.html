<h1>The switch statement</h1>

<p>In this topic we will
examine the <em>switch</em> statement. We will also look at
prefix and postfix operators in more detail.</p>
    

<h2>The switch statement</h2>

<p>Java, in common with most C-based languages, includes an alternative conditional
statement to the <em>if</em> statement, namely the <em>switch</em> statement.
Often we find ourselves having to write very long winded <em>if/else</em> statements
to cover a wide range of possibilities, e.g:
<pre>public class IfCallingCodesApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the international dialling code :");
        String codeAsString = scanner.nextLine();
        int code = Integer.parseInt(codeAsString);
        
    
        
        if(code == 44)
        {
            System.out.println("UK");
        }
        else if (code == 33)
        {
            System.out.println("France");
        }
        else if (code == 1)
        {
            System.out.println("USA or Canada");
        }
        else if (code == 49)
        {
            System.out.println("Germany");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Don't know");
        }
    }
}</pre>
This works, but arguably the code is a bit long-winded and hard to read. An alternative is to use the <em>switch</em> statement, shown below:
<pre>public class SwitchCallingCodesApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the international dialling code :");
        String codeAsString = scanner.nextLine();
        int code = Integer.parseInt(codeAsString);
        
    
        switch(code)
        {
            case 44:
                System.out.println("UK");
                break;
                
            case 33:
                System.out.println("France");
                break;    
                
            case 1:
                System.out.println("USA or Canada");
                break;
                
            case 49:
                System.out.println("Germany");
                break;
                
            default:
                System.out.println("Don't know");
                
        }
    }
}</pre>
This shows the use of a <em>switch</em> statement. We <em>switch</em> on the variable we want to test
(<em>code</em> here) and consider the <em>case</em> of each of the values we want to test for.
In each <em>case</em> statement we write all the code relating to that case (e.g. 44 for UK) and
then <em>break</em> out of the switch statement. Note that the <em>break</em> is compulsory in this
example. If we miss the <em>break</em> out, it will continue running the next case.
(Why is this? The next example, below, will explain).</p>
<p>Also note the <em>default</em> case. This will trap anything not covered by the specified cases.
So if the user enters something other than 44, 33, 1 or 49, then "Don't know" will be printed.</p>
<h4>Exercise 1</h4>
<p>Try the switch example above. Remove the <em>break</em> statements from each <em>case</em> and try running
it again, testing out each recognised dialling code. What happens?</p>
<h3>Multiple cases, one effect</h3>
<p>There are many cases where we want a <em>group</em> of cases to have the same effect. For example imagine
a program which displays which season a month is in. This might look like this:
<pre>public class SeasonsSwitchApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the month :");
        String month = scanner.nextLine();
    
        
    
        switch(month)
        {
            case "December":
            case "January":
            case "February":
                System.out.println("Winter");
                break;
                
            case "March":
            case "April":
            case "May":
                System.out.println("Spring");
                break;    
                
            case "June":
            case "July":
            case "August":
                System.out.println("Summer");
                break;
                
            case "September":
            case "October":
            case "November":
                System.out.println("Autumn");
                break;
                
            default:
                System.out.println("Not a real month");
                
        }
    }
}</pre>
In this example, note how we group cases together. So if <em>month</em>
is either December, January or February, Winter will be printed.
This is why cases "fall through" to the next case if the <em>break</em>
is missing. This example also shows that
<em>you can use strings in switch statements, as well as integers</em>.
This has not always been the case, but has been since Java 7.</p>
<h4>Exercise 2</h4>
<ol>
<li>Using a switch statement, write a program which reads in a grade (A, B, C, D or F) and
displays the equivalent degree classification. Use the following guidelines:
    <ul>
    <li>A = First;</li>
    <li>B or C = Second;</li>
    <li>D = Third;</li>
    <li>F = Fail.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Using a switch statement, write a program which reads in two numbers and an operator (+, -, / or *) and performs the appropriate mathematical calculation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Prefix and postfix operators</h2>

<p>You have already seen statements such as:
<pre>a++;</pre>
to increase a variable by one. This is called a <em>postfix</em> operator because the "++" comes <em>after</em> 
the variable. However, we can also have the related <em>prefix</em> operator:
<pre>++a;</pre>
which does the same thing. What, then, is the difference between them? They have different meanings when the
variable is <em>assigned to another</em>. For example we can have statements such as:
<pre>int b = a++;</pre>
or
<pre>int c = ++a;</pre>
What do these two statements do and what is the difference between them?
    <ul>
    <li>The postfix operator does the assignment <em>and then</em> increases the variable by one. So
    <pre>int b=a++;</pre>
    is equivalent to:
    <pre>int b=a;
a++;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>The prefix operator <em>increases the variable first</em> and then assigns 
    <em>the new value of the variable</em> to the other variable. So
    <pre>int c=++a;</pre>
    is equivalent to:
    <pre>++a;
int c=a;</pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
This can have consequences for loops. For instance:
<pre>while(++i &lt; 10)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}</pre>
will count from 1 to 9, but
<pre>while(i++ &lt; 10)
{
    System.out.println(i);
}</pre>
will count from 1 to 10.
</p>
<p> 
This is because the statement:
<pre>while(++i &lt; 10)</pre>
increases i <em>first</em> and <em>then</em> compares it with the value 10. So if <em>i</em> is 9, 
<em>i</em> will be increased by one first and then compared to 10. Since it will now be 10, the
loop will not run.</p>
<p>By contrast:
<pre>while(i++ &lt; 10)</pre>
compares i with the value 10 <em>first</em> and then increases it by one. So if <em>i</em> is 9,
<em>i</em> will be compared with 10; it will be less than 10 so the loop will run. <em>After</em> comparing
<em>i</em> with 10, <em>i</em> will be increased by one - but by that time the test will already have been
passed. So the result will be that the loop will run another
time with <em>i</em> having the value 10.</p>
