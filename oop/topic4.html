<h2>Encapsulation</h2>

<p>Object-oriented programming makes use of a technique called <em>encapsulation</em>. If we revise last week's
Cat class:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk()
    {
        this.weight--;
    }

    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
}
</pre>
you can see the use of the keywords <em>private</em> and <em>public</em> throughout the code. What do these
mean?
    <ul>
    <li>Any attribute or method preceded by the keyword <em>private</em> can only be used <em>inside the
    current class</em>.</li>
    <li>Any attribute or method preceded by the keyword <em>public</em> can be used <em>both inside and 
    outside the class</em>.</li>
    </ul>
So you can see that in this example, <em>the methods can be used outside the class</em> but 
<em>the attributes can only be used inside the class</em>. The main() called the two <em>methods</em>,
walk() and display(), and all references to the <em>attributes</em> are within the methods inside the
class.</p>
<p>This is common practice and is known as <em>encapsulation</em>. Encapsulation means to
keep the inner workings of the class hidden from the outside world, and control access to those inner workings
by means of the methods, which act as "gateways" between the outside world and the interior of the class.
</p>
<p>Why is encapsulation performed? Consider this new version of the Cat class:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk()
    {
        if(this.weight &lt;= 5)
        {
            System.out.println("Can't walk any further... poor cat will be starved!");
        }
        else
        {
            this.weight--;
        }
        
    }

    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
}
</pre>
This new version includes an <em>if</em> statement inside the <em>walk()</em> method, which prevents the cat
from walking if the weight is 5 or less. Thus we are <em>controlling how the cat's weight can be altered</em>
using the walk() method. So if we tried the following in the main():
<pre>
public class EncapsulationApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat tigger = new Cat ("Tigger", 5 , 7);
        
        tigger.walk();
        tigger.walk();
        
        tigger.walk();
    }
}
</pre>
The first two calls to <em>walk()</em> would succeed, as the weight would be reduced from 7 to 6 and then from
6 to 5. However the third call to <em>walk()</em> would fail, as the weight would now be 5 and cannot be reduced
any further.</p>
<p>Note how we have <em>used encapsulation to prevent unrealistic things happening</em>. The following code will
<em>not compile</em> but <em>only because weight is private</em>:
<pre>
public class NoEncapsulationApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat tigger = new Cat ("Tigger", 5 , 7);
    
        tigger.weight = -1;
    }
}
</pre>
If the weight was not <em>private</em>, you would legitimately be able to set it to -1 from the main() as in the
above example. This illustrates the whole concept of encapsulation: <em>to keep the inner workings of a class
private and control access from the outside world, to prevent the outside world doing unrealistic things.</em>
</p>
<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Modify the Cat's <em>eat()</em> method so that the weight can never go above 50. Print a suitable error
message if an attempt is made to increase the weight beyond that amount.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accessor and mutator methods</h3>
<p>It is fairly common in object-oriented programming that we wish to access a <em>single attribute</em>, such
as, for example, the name of the cat. We wish to keep this attribute <em>private</em>, so that the outside world
cannot arbitarily change it, but we still wish the outside world to <em>access</em> it. How can we do this?
We can use an <em>accessor method</em>, also referred to as a "getter". Here is a version of the Cat class with
accessor methods for the three attributes:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk()
    {
        if(this.weight &lt;= 5)
        {
            System.out.println("Can't walk any further... poor cat will be starved!");
        }
        else
        {
            this.weight--;
        }
        
    }

    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
    
    <em>
    public String getName()
    {
        return this.name;
    }
    
    public int getAge()
    {
        return this.age;
    }
    
    public int getWeight()
    {
        return this.weight;
    }
    </em>
}
</pre>
</p>
<h4>Specifying the return types of methods</h4>
<p>Note how these three methods, <em>getName()</em>, <em>getAge()</em> and <em>getWeight()</em>, are 
<em>returning</em> the corresponding attribute. Note also how we <em>specify the return type</em> when
writing the method:
<pre>public <em>String</em> getName()</pre>
When writing methods, <em>the return type always immediately precedes the method name.</em> So we are saying that
the <em>getName()</em> method <em>returns</em> a String. Likewise, getAge() and getWeight() both
<em>return</em> an int.</p>
<h4>Using the accessor methods from the main()</h4>
<p>The example below shows how we can use the accessor methods in the main() to get individual pieces of 
information about the cat object:
<pre>
public class AccessorsApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat tigger = new Cat ("Tigger", 5 , 7);
        Cat tom = new Cat ("Tom", 10, 10);
    
        System.out.println (tigger.getName());
        System.out.println (tigger.getAge());
        System.out.println (tom.getWeight());
    }
}
</pre>
Note how we use commands such as:
<pre>System.out.println (tigger.getName());</pre>
What this line is doing is <em>printing the return value of the getName() method</em>, which,
as we can see above, is the <em>name</em> attribute of the Cat object. </p>
<p>This example illustrates how we can use getter methods <em>to provide "read" access to an attribute but
to prevent "write" access.</em> We can obtain the value of the attribute by using the getter method, but we
cannot change its attribute. This is a further example of encapsulation: we allow the outside world to access
the attributes but we do not allow the outside world to arbitrarily change them.</p>
</p>
<h4>Mutator methods</h4>
<p>As well as accessor methods, we can also add <em>mutator</em> methods to <em>update</em> attributes. These
are also called <em>setter</em> methods because we use them to <em>set</em> data. However, unlike accessors,
they typically have some sort of controls to prevent the data being set to unrealistic values. For example,
a setWeight() method for a Cat would probably prevent the weight being set to less than 0. An example of
such a method is shown below.
<pre>public class Cat
{
    private int weight;
    
    // ...other code omitted...
    
    public void setWeight (int newWeight)
    {
        if(newWeight &gt; 0)
        {
            this.weight = newWeight;
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Cannot set weight to 0 or less.");
        }
    }
}</pre>
</p>



<h2>Passing Parameters to Methods</h2>

<p>
You have already seen the concept of passing parameters to a constructor. In Introduction to Programming and
Problem Solving, you also passed parameters to functions. Hopefully it should not then be too much of a 
surprise that you can also pass parameters to regular Java methods. If we take a look at another version of
our Cat class:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk (int distance)
    {
        this.weight -= distance;
    }

    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
}
</pre>
Note how the <em>walk</em> method now takes one parameter, representing the distance walked. We also
reduce the weight by the distance. (Note that <em>this.weight -= distance;</em> is a shorter
way of writing <em>this.weight = this.weight - distance;</em>; the <em>-=</em> operator reduces a variable
by a given value). This could be called in a <em>main()</em> as follows:
<pre>
public class CatAppWithParameters
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat tigger = new Cat ("Tigger", 10, 10);
        
        tigger.walk (5);
        tigger.display();
        tigger.walk (3);
        tigger.display();
    }
}
</pre>
Note how we are passing the distance to the walk method. Note the difference between
<em>arguments</em> and <em>parameters</em>.
The <em>value passed into a method</em> is called an <em>argument</em>, whereas the <em>parameter</em> is the <em>variable</em> in the method representing that
value. So, here, 5 and 3 are the <em>arguments</em> whereas <em>distance</em> is the <em>parameter</em>.
</p>
<h3>Multiple parameters</h3>
<p>A method can have more than one parameter. This version of the Cat class has a modified <em>walk()</em>
method which makes the cat lose more weight if they walk faster (the weight is reduced by the distance multiplied
by the speed):
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk (int distance, int speed)
    {
        this.weight -= distance*speed;
    }

    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
}
</pre>
This could then be called in the <em>main()</em> as follows:
<pre>
public class CatAppWithMultipleParameters
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat tigger = new Cat ("Tigger", 10, 15);
        
        tigger.walk (5, 1);
        tigger.display();
        tigger.walk (3, 2);
        tigger.display();
    }
}
</pre>
The cat initially walks a distance of 5 units with a speed of 1, and then walks a distance of 3 units with
a speed of 2. So for the first walk() the cat will lose 5 units of weight and for the second walk the cat
will lose 6 units of weight.</p>
<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
<ol>

<li>Modify your Cat's <em>eat()</em> method further, so that it now takes a parameter of <em>amount</em>.
The weight should increase by the specified amount.</li>
<li>Go back to your Hero class from last week. 
Make the attributes <em>public</em> and try setting the lives to an unreasonable value, such as -1.
Does it work?
Now make the attribute <em>private</em> again. Does it still work or does the compiler give an error?
</li>
<li>Add accessor methods to the Hero class to read the score and the number of lives.</li>
<li>Modify the <em>loseLife()</em> method inside Hero to prevent the lives ever going below zero.</li>
<li>Add a boolean <em>isAlive()</em> method which returns true or false depending on whether the lives are zero, or more than zero.</li>
</ol>

<h3>More advanced questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>(More advanced) Write a Clock class to represent a clock. It should have:
    <ul>
    <li>hours, minutes and seconds attributes;</li>
    <li>a constructor with <em>no</em> parameters, which sets hours, minutes and seconds to zero;</li>
    <li>a <em>setTime()</em> method. This should take three parameters (hours, minutes and seconds) and
    set the hours, minutes and seconds attributes of the clock appropriately, but 
    <em>validate them first</em>. If any are out of range (assume we are dealing with a 24-hour clock)
    then reject the values and display an appropriate error message.</li>
    <li>a <em>tick()</em> method. This should move the seconds on by one. It should also advance minutes and
    hours appropriately, e.g: 09:59:59 should become 10:00:00 and 23:59:59 should become 00:00:00!</li>
    <li>a <em>display()</em> method which displays the time. If the current time is on the hour then try doing
    a loop to display "BONG" the appropriate number of times!</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Return to your Hero class and:
	<ul>
	<li>Add attributes for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates to the Hero. These will represent the hero's position on the screen.
	Also add <em>getX()</em> and <em>getY()</em> accessor methods.</li>
	<li>Modify the Hero's <em>printDetails()</em> to display the current x and y coordinates. </li>
	<li>Write a Monster class to represent a monster. It should also have x and y coordinates, and 
	a <em>chase()</em> method to chase the hero. This should take a Hero object as a parameter, and
	should move the monster towards the hero by comparing the x and y coordinates of the 
	monster with that of the hero.</li>
	<li>Add a boolean <em>eaten()</em> method to the Monster. This should also take a Hero as a parameter and test if the x and y coordinates of the hero and
	monster are equal.</li>
	<li>Add <em>getX()</em> and <em>getY()</em> methods to the Monster class.</li>
	<li>Try creating a hero and a monster in a <em>main()</em> method. Using a while loop, make the monster "chase" the hero until the hero has
	been eaten. On each go of the loop, display the hero and monster's current X and Y coordinates.
	(Next time, you will actually do this in a graphical environment!)</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>
