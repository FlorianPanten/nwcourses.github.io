<h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
<h1>Week 2: Conditional statements and loops</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This week we will look at conditional statements (if statements) and loops (while,
do/while and for loops). You have already seen examples of each in Python but this Topic will show you how
to write them in Java.</p>

<h2>The if statement in Java</h2>

<p>This example shows how to do an <em>if</em> statement in Java:
<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GuessTheYearApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println ("Which year was the most recent London Olympics?");
        String yearAsString = scanner.nextLine();
        int year = Integer.parseInt(yearAsString);
        
        if(year==2012)
        {
            System.out.println("Correct!");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Wrong!");
        }
    }
}
</pre>
Hopefully you can recognise the <em>if</em> / <em>else</em> structure that you have seen
already in Python. The main things to note here are:
    <ul>
    <li>Note the test that we are doing in the <em>if</em> statement:
    <pre>if(year==2012)</pre>
    Note how we use <em>==</em> (double equals) to test whether a variable is equal to a value.
    A single equals (<em>=</em>) is used to assign a value to a variable.</li>
    <li>Note the use of the braces (curly brackets) { and } to begin and end the <em>code block</em>
    associated with the <em>if</em> and <em>else</em> keywords. Last time, when we were looking at the
    Hello World application, we looked at the concept of code blocks as sections of code beginning and
    ending with braces. Everything within the code blocks here relates
    to the "if" or the "else", as appropriate. So the System.out.println statement:
    <pre>System.out.println("Correct!");</pre>
    will run if the user entered the correct year, while the statement:
    <pre>System.out.println("Wrong!");</pre>
    will run if the user entered the wrong year.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>In addition to simply having an <em>if</em> block and an <em>else</em> block,
we can also have one or more <em>else if</em> blocks to handle multiple conditions.
The example below shows this (the previous London Olympics before 2012 was in 1948):
<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GuessTheYearApp2
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println ("Which year was the most recent London Olympics?");
        String yearAsString = scanner.nextLine();
        int year = Integer.parseInt(yearAsString);
        
        if(year==2012)
        {
            System.out.println("Correct!");
        }
        else if (year==1948)
        {
            System.out.println("I said the *most recent* London Olympics!");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Wrong!");
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Comparison and logical operators in Java</h2>
<p>Like other languages, Java has comparison and logical operators. Here is a list of the most common
comparison operators:
        <ul>
        <li><em>==</em>: is equal to (note the double equals!)</li>
        <li><em>&lt;</em> : less than</li>
        <li><em>&gt;</em> : greater than</li>
        <li><em>&lt;=</em> : less than or equal to</li>
        <li><em>&gt;=</em> : greater than or equal to</li>
        <li><em>!=</em> : not equal to</em>
        <li><em>!</em> (in front of an expression) : <em>not</em> (negates the expression)</li>
        </ul>
</p>
<p>and here are the two most common logical operators:
    <ul>
    <li><em>&amp;&amp;</em> : and</li>
    <li><em>||</em>: or</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Exercise 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Modify the second example above so that the <em>"I said the most recent..."</em>
message appears if the user entered 1908 as well as 1948. (There was also a London
Olympics in 1908).</li>
<li>Modify the second example above so that it displays <em>"Earlier!"</em> if the year was after 2012 or
<em>"Later!"</em> if the year was before 2012.</li>
<li>Write a program to calculate a train fare dependent on your age. Imagine that train fares are half price
if you are under 18 or over 65. The program should allow the user to enter the full-price train fare (a double) and the
user's age, and then display the train fare that the user has to pay dependent on their age. 
<em>There is a Double.parseDouble() which is equivalent to Integer.parseInt() for converting Strings to doubles.</em></li>
<li>Enhance this program so that invalid ages (an age less than 0, or an age of 128 or more) are rejected. The program should
just end (you can use <em>System.exit(0);</em> to quit the program)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Loops in Java</h2>

<p>In common with other languages, you can write <em>loops</em> in Java. You should remember from 
Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving that a <em>loop</em> involves repeating the same
section of code over and over again until some condition is met. Java has four types of loops:
    <ul>
    <li>The while loop;</li>
    <li>The do/while loop;</li>
    <li>The for loop;</li>
    <li>The foreach loop.</li>
    </ul>
We will look at the first three for now, and come back to the foreach loop later.</p>

<h3>The "while" loop in Java</h3>

<p>The <em>while</em> loop is probably the simplest loop in Java. It simply loops until a particular 
condition is met. For example:
<pre>
public class WhileLoopApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int i = 1;
        
        while(i &lt;= 10)
        {
            System.out.println("Number = " + i);
            System.out.println("Square of number = " + i*i);
            i++;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
This example initialises an integer variable <em>i</em> to 1 and then loops while the variable <em>i</em>
is less than or equal to 10. Of note is:
    <ul>
    <li>the use of a <em>code block</em> again, beginning with the
    bracket <em>{</em> and ending with <em>}</em>. This defines the code which is associated with the loop. So the
    two System.out.println statements will be printed 10 times.</li>
    <li>Also note the use of <em>i++</em>. This is what is called the <em>postfix</em> operator. It is a 
    shorthand way of writing <em>i=i+1;</em>, in other words it increases the variable <em>i</em> by one.
    You can also do <em>i--</em> too to reduce <em>i</em> by one.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Exercise 2</h4>
<ol>
<li>Change the program above to count <em>down</em> from 20 to 2 in steps of 2.</li>
<li>Rewrite the basic "Guess the Olympics year" program to use a while loop rather than an if statement, so that if
the user gets the year wrong, they should be given another chance. (This
should be the basic version of the program, do not worry about previous
Olympic years; just say "Correct" or "Wrong" depending on whether it's
2012 or not.  Also, initially, do not distinguish between pre-2012 
and post-2012 years).</li>
<li>Enhance question 2 so that the program distinguishes between pre-2012 and post-2012 years, by having an
<em>if</em> statement <em>inside</em> your <em>while</em> loop.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The "do/while" loop in Java</h3>

<p>The <em>do/while</em> loop is similar to the while loop, but performs the check at the
<em>end of the loop</em> rather than the beginning. For example:
<pre>
public class DoWhileLoopApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int i = 1;
        
        do
        {
            System.out.println("Number = " + i);
            System.out.println("Square of number = " + i*i);
            i++;
        }while(i &lt;= 10);
    }
}
</pre>
Sometimes the logic of a loop means that it's better to put the check at the end of the loop rather than the
beginning, and the do/while loop allows us to do that. Note also how we need to put a semicolon after the
<em>while</em> condition; this is because the statement ends here, whereas for a <em>while</em> loop the
condition is at the beginning of the loop. A common mistake is to add a semicolon to
an ordinary <em>while</em> loop:
<pre>
public class InfiniteWhileLoopApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int i = 1;
        
        while(i &lt;= 10)<em>;</em>
        {
            System.out.println("Number = " + i);
            System.out.println("Square of number = " + i*i);
            i++;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
This is a logical error because a semicolon always terminates a statement, and in this example will therefore
terminate the <em>while</em> statement and separate it from its code block. 
<em>while(i &lt;= 10);</em> is basically equivalent 
to writing the while loop with an empty code block, i.e.:<pre>
while(i &lt;= 10)
{
}</pre>
The result is that the <em>while</em> statement will 
loop infinitely, because it is testing for <em>i</em> being less than or equal to 10, and <em>i</em> is
never increased beyond 1 within the loop.</p>
<h3>The for loop</h3>
<p>Java also has a <em>for</em> loop, in common with many other languages. The for loop might take some
getting used to if you have not programmed in any other "C like" language such as C or C++. The syntax is:
<pre>for(initialisation; continue condition; change)</pre>
where:
    <ul>
    <li><em>initialisation</em> is the start condition - typically the initialisation of a loop variable;</li>
    <li><em>continue condition</em> is the condition which must be true for the loop to continue;</li>
    <li><em>change</em> is the change each time the loop runs: typically we change the value of a loop variable here.</li>
    </ul>
An example:
<pre>for(int i=1; i&lt;=10; i++)</pre>
Here:
    <ul>
    <li>the <em>initialisation</em> is <em>i=1</em>, i.e. when we first enter the loop, the variable <em>i</em> will be initialised to 1.
    Note that <em>we declare i at the same time as initialising it</em> with <em>int</em> i=1;. This prevents us having to 
    declare <em>i</em> outside the loop.</li>
    <li>the <em>continue condition</em> is <em>i&lt;=10</em>, i.e. the loop will continue running while the variable <em>i</em> is less than 
    or equal to 10;</li>
    <li>the <em>change</em> is <em>i++</em>, i.e. each time the loop runs, we increase the value of <em>i</em> by one.</li>
    </ul>
Here is a full example:
<pre>
public class ForLoopApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {    
        for(int i=1; i &lt;= 10; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Number = " + i);
            System.out.println("Square of number = " + i*i);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
Compare this to the <em>while</em> loop example. While it may be a little harder to understand the
syntax of the for loop if you are new to it, it is more concise. When we used a while loop, we needed
to initialise <em>i</em> and increase <em>i</em> by one on separate lines; with a for loop, we put
both those lines inside the <em>for</em> statement.
</p>
<h4>Exercise 3</h4>
<ol>
<li>Using a <em>for</em> loop, write a program to display a given character a certain number of times.
Ask the user for the character and the number of times from the keyboard. For example if they entered "#" and
8, it should display:
<pre>########</pre>
<strong>Hint:</strong> Use System.out.print(), rather than System.out.println(), to display a string without starting a new line.
</li>
<li>Using a <em>for</em> loop within another <em>for</em> loop, write a program to display an ASCII-art triangle
with a certain number of lines. Each line should have one character more than the previous. The user should be able to enter the character (as a string)
and the number of lines.
For example if the user
entered "*" and 4, it should display:
<pre>*
**
***
****</pre>
<strong>Hint:</strong> Use System.out.print("\n"); to start a new line. <em>\n</em> is one of several <em>escape codes</em> in Java: it is 
a special code to indicate a new line.
</li>
</ol>
