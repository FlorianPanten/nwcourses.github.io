<h1>Object Oriented Design and Development</h1>
<h1>Week 1: Introduction to Java</h1>
</div>

<h2>Introduction to the module</h2>

<p>So far on your course you have been introduced to the fundamentals of programming using Python. You have learnt about variables, loops, conditional statements, arrays and functions as well as <em>object-oriented programming</em>.
As you saw last year, object-oriented (OO) programming
involves writing code to represent real world <em>objects</em> such as a student, a car, players and enemies in games, or graphical user interface elements such as windows and buttons. As you will hopefully see in this
module, once you have learnt it, OO programming leads to more readable, more maintainable code.</p>

<p>Object-oriented programming can be used in many languages, such as Python, JavaScript, or C++. One of the most popular OO languages, however, is <em>Java</em>, and we will use Java in this module.  It is one of the most commonly-used OO languages today.  It is also used in many general-purpose desktop and web applications. The principal benefit of Java is that it is <em>cross-platform</em>: you can write a Java program on Windows and the same program will work on other
operating systems such as Linux or Mac OS X. </p>

<p>This week will cover a fast-track <em>introduction to Java</em> aimed at developers who have had some basic experience with object-oriented programming in another language, such as Python. As you will have done COM411 before this module, that should include you.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Java</h2>

<p>Java is a <em>combined compiled/interpreted language</em>. What does this mean?

    <ul>
    <li>A <em>compiled</em> language is a language which is converted from source code into
    <em>machine code for the machine's CPU, in an executable format understandable by the machine's
    operating system</em>. This conversion is done by a piece of software known as a <em>compiler</em>.
    For example, on a Windows/Intel system, Intel machine code instructions would
    be stored in a .EXE file. On a Linux/Intel system, Intel machine code instructions would be stored
    in a Linux executable file, which has a different format to an .EXE but still contains Intel 
    instructions. On a smartphone with an ARM processor, ARM machine code instructions would
    be generated. C++ is an example of a compiled language. 
    You write C++ code and then <em>compile it into machine code</em> for the target CPU and operating system.
    Machine code is a <em>binary</em> format: a series of bytes which mean something to a CPU but cannot be
    read in a text editor.</li>
    <li>An <em>interpreted</em> language is a language in which each line of code is read by a piece of 
    software known as an <em>interpreter</em> at <em>run time</em>, i.e. when you run the program.
    Interpreted languages are slower than compiled languages. With a compiled language, you run the
    executable which contains machine code, and machine code is directly understood by the CPU.
    With interpreted languages, the process of interpreting each line of code at run time is a slow one
    in comparison to the CPU executing instructions that it understands directly. On the other hand,
    interpreted languages are easier to debug, as you can simply edit the code: with compiled languages, you
    need to compile again, and if the machine code generated by the compiler contains certain types of errors
    (e.g. trying to add an element to an array outside its bounds) there is the risk that the computer will
    crash.</li>
    </ul>

</p>
<p>Java does not exactly fit into either category, but instead adopts a hybrid approach. You 
<em>compile</em> a Java program, but it is not compiled into native machine code. Instead, it is compiled into a format known as
<em>bytecode</em>. Bytecode is a binary format understood by the <em>Java Virtual Machine</em>. The Java 
Virtual Machine (part of the <em>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</em>) is a piece of software which reads and executes Java bytecode, and in doing so, runs your Java program. This is the <em>interpreted</em> part of the
Java system. The result is that <em>any computer with the JRE installed</em> can read Java bytecode. So you can distribute Java bytecode to Windows, Linux or Mac systems, and as long as they have the JRE installed, they will all be able to run your program.
Because it is a compact, machine-friendly format, the Java Virtual Machine can read Java bytecode
faster than interpreters in pure interpreted languages can read text files of source code. </p>
<p>The diagram below compares a standard compiled language and Java.

<h3>Hello World in Java</h3>
<p>Here is a Hello World application in Java.
<pre>
public class HelloWorldApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello Java World!");
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Explanation of the code</h3>
<p>We will now explain the Java code line by line.
<pre>public class HelloWorldApp</pre>
All Java programs consist of one or more <em>classes</em>. A <em>class</em> is, as you saw last year in Python, a code representation of a real-world entity, such as a person or a cat. Here, the class is representing the application as
a whole, which is why we have called it <code>HelloWorldApp</code>. <strong>In Java, unlike Python, all code must be placed in a class!</strong>
<pre> { </pre>
Opening curly brackets begin a <em>code block</em> in Java. Code blocks are closed with a closing bracket <code>}</code>. Indentation is not compulsory, but is extremely strongly recommended in Java (for code readability) and failing to indent your code will not make you popular!
<pre>public static void main (String[] args)</pre>
This begins the <em><code>main()</code> method</em>. A <em>method</em> is a function 
inside a class. The <code>main()</code> method is a special
method in Java: it is the entry point of the program. So when you run a Java program, the first code that will be run will be the code inside the <code>main()</code> method.
<pre> { </pre>
This begins the code block associated with the <code>main()</code> method.
<pre>System.out.println("Hello Java World!");</pre>
The <code>System.out.println()</code> statement prints the specified message to the screen. So here,
<em>Hello Java World!</em> will be printed to the screen. <strong>Note how we must end our statements with a semicolon.</strong> This differs from Python. The semicolon is compulsory!
<pre> } </pre>
This curly bracket closes the main() method.
<pre> } </pre>
... and the second curly bracket closes the class.
</p>
<h2>Setting up a project in Netbeans</h2>
<p>We will use the <em>Netbeans</em> IDE to develop our code (version 14). This should be installed on the university computers, or can be downloaded from <a href='https://netbeans.apache.org'>here</a>. Each application you write should be placed in a separate <em>project</em>. To create a project:
<ul>
<li>Select <em>File</em>/<em>New project</em>.</li>
<li>Select <em>Java with Maven</em> and <em>Java Application</em>, as shown in the screenshot below:
<br />
<img src="../images/netbeans1.png" alt="Choosing a project type in Netbeans" />
<br />
</li>
<li>Give your project a name, as shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/netbeans2.png" alt="Giving your project a name" />
<br />
</li>
<li>A code editing window will then appear, as shown below. Type in your code. Your application can be run via the green "Play" button in the toolbar, as shown in the screenshot:
<br />
<img src="../images/netbeans3.png" alt="Running a project" />
<br />
</li>
<li>Your application's output will then appear in the Output window, below the code editor, as shown below:
<br />
<img src="../images/netbeans4.png" alt="Program output" />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Arithmetic operators in Java</h2>
<p>Java has the standard set of arithmetic operators, which are generally the same as Python, e.g. +, -, *, / or %. </p>
<h2>Data types in Java</h2>
<p>A difference between Java and Python is that Java is a <em>strongly typed</em> language. What does this mean?  Whereas in Python, you do not need to declare the <em>data type</em> of a variable (by data type, we mean integer, floating-point, string and so on), in Java you do. Java has the following data types.
These types are all known as <em>primitive types</em>. A primitive type is a fundamental data type built into 
the language, as opposed to a user-defined data type, created by the developer.
    <ul>
    <li><code>boolean</code>: represents a boolean, i.e. true or false, value. Expressions return boolean values. Note that in Java, unlike in Python, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are <em>lower case</em>.</li>
    <li><code>byte</code>: represents a single byte of data. Can hold the values 0 to 255.</li>
    <li><code>char</code>: represents individual characters such as 'a', '!' or '$'. You will have met the
    <em>ASCII character set</em> where the values between 0 and 127 represent single characters
    (letters, numbers and punctuation from American English). An extended version, covering values 0 to 255, accounts for Western European characters (French, German etc as well as currency symbols such as the pound and the euro). However, the <code>char</code> data type in Java is designed to hold characters from international character sets such as Greek, Cyrillic (used in many Eastern European languages), Chinese or Arabic and therefore <code>char</code> occupies <em>two bytes</em> in Java. The two-byte system for representing characters is called <em>Unicode</em>.</li>
    <li><code>int</code>: represents an integer (a whole number). Occupies four bytes (32 bits). 
    Can hold positive and negative values, and therefore can store values from -2<sup>31</sup> to +2<sup>31</sup>-1 (31 bits for the number, 1 bit for the sign).</li>
    <li><code>long</code>: represents larger whole numbers. Occupies eight bytes (64 bits). Again can hold positive
    and negative values, and therefore can store values from -2<sup>63</sup> to +2<sup>63</sup>-1.</li>
    <li><code>short</code>: represents smaller whole numbers in situations where memory is limited. 
    Occupies two bytes (16 bits). Again can hold positive
    and negative values, and therefore can store values from -2<sup>15</sup> to +2<sup>15</sup>-1
    (-65536 to +65535)</li>
    <li><code>float</code>: represents floating-point numbers. Occupies four bytes. Recommended where memory is short
    but due to the relatively low precision, not recommended for applications such as 
    scientific and financial data.</li>
    <li><code>double</code>: represents double-precision floating-point numbers. Occupies eight bytes.
    Recommended for operations where high precision is vital, such as scientific and financial data.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>When you wish to use a variable for the first time in Java, you have to <em>declare</em> it.
Declaring a variable involves stating its name and what data type it is. If you try to use a variable without
having first declared it, you wil get an error. For example, the code extract (note that this is not a complete
program, just an extract of code):
<pre>int a;
a=3;</pre>
will declare that the variable <code>a</code> exists and is an <code>int</code>, and then assigns the value 3 to
it. However:
<pre>a=3;</pre>
on its own will give a compiler error as the variable <code>a</code> has not been declared yet.
We can also <em>declare a variable and initialise it in one statement</em>. The following does this:
<pre>int a=3;</pre>
</p>
<p>Here is a complete program which declares some variables and uses them.
<pre>
public class VariablesApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int a;
        a = 2;
        System.out.println("The variable a is: " + a);
        double b = 3.1415927;
        System.out.println("The variable b is: " + b);
        float c = 1.234f;
        System.out.println("The variable c is: " + c);
    }
}
</pre>
</p>
Note how, when we initialise a <code>float</code> variable, we have to add the character "f"
after the number, i.e. <em>1.234f</em>. This distinguishes between <code>double</code> and <code>float</code> numbers.  A decimal number without an "f" is treated as a double, while one with an "f" is treated as a float.</p>
<h3>Loss of precision</h3>
<p>When dealing with basic Java data types, you might come across a <em>loss of precision error</em>. For example:
<pre>int e = 2.718281828;</pre>
Does this work? No: it generates a <em>loss of precision error</em>. The number
<em>2.718281828</em> is a <code>double</code>. However, we are trying to put a double inside an int variable.
<em>int</em> variables can only hold whole numbers, so we are unable to store the double inside the variable
without losing precision. Because this sort of situation is likely to be a programming error, the compiler
refuses to allow the loss of precision and generates an error.</p>
<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>Java also has the concept of a <em>string</em>. As you should know from COM411, <em>string</em> is a sequence of characters and is therefore used to store words, sentences, paragraphs and so
on. In Java, the data type for a string is <code>String</code>. Unlike the data types you met above, however,
<em>String</em> is not a primitive type. It is a <em>class</em>. Remember you 
saw earlier that a <em>class</em> is a representation of a real-world entity. So the Java <code>String</code> class
is a representation of a string.</p>
<p>Luckily, strings are quite easy to use. Here is an example program which uses strings. 
<pre>
public class StringsApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        String str, str2;
        str = "Hello";
        str2 = "World!";
        System.out.println(str);
        System.out.println(str + str2);
        System.out.println(str + " " + str2);
    }
}
</pre>
This example shows how we declare <code>String</code> variables in the same way that we declare variables using
primitive types. The example also shows some other new concepts:
    <ul>
    <li>Note how we can declare multiple variables of the same data type 
    on the same line, by separating them with a comma:
    <pre>String str, str2;</pre>
    We could also declare <em>and initialise</em> multiple variables on the same line, e.g.:
    <pre>String str="Hello", str2="World!";</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Note how we use the <code>+</code> (addition)
    operator to join (concatenate) strings together.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Obtaining user input in Java</h2>
<p>To obtain user input in Java, we use a <code>Scanner</code>. Here is an example of the use of a Scanner:
<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        String str = "";
        Scanner scanner1 = new Scanner (System.in);
        System.out.println("Please enter a string:");
        str = scanner1.nextLine();
        System.out.println("You entered: " + str);
    }
}
</pre>
To consider this example:
<ul>
<li>
<pre>Scanner scanner1 = new Scanner(System.in)</pre>
This line creates a new scanner called <code>scanner1</code> and associates it with <em>standard input</em>
(<code>System.in</code>). Standard input represents the flow of information from the keyboard to the program. (Likewise,
standard <em>output</em> represents the flow of information out of the program, typically to a screen; this is
what <code>System.out</code> represents in <code>System.out.println()</code>.
</li>
<li> Hopefully you can see that <code>Scanner.nextLine()</code> reads in a line of text from the keyboard and stores
it in a String variable.</li>
<li>Also note the line:
<pre>import java.util.Scanner;</pre>
This is importing <code>Scanner</code> from the <em>package</em> <code>java.util</code>. This is rather like importing modules in Python.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Scanners and numbers</h3>
<p>It is possible to use the Scanner to read in numbers from the keyboard. There are dedicated methods for doing
this, such as <code>nextInt()</code> or <code>nextDouble()</code> (rather than nextLine() ) but using a mix of these
and <code>nextLine()</code> can lead to problems where new line (ENTER) characters are left in the input and can
disrupt subsequent attempts to read in data. So a better approach is to read in <em>everything as a string</em>
and <em>convert the string input to a numeric data type, as required</em>. The example below shows this:
<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberScannerApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        String str = "";
        Scanner scanner1 = new Scanner (System.in);
        System.out.println("Please enter an integer:");
        str = scanner1.nextLine();
        int i = <em>Integer.parseInt(str);</em>
        System.out.println("You entered the integer " + i);
    }
}
</pre>
Note how we read the input in as a string and then <em>convert it to an integer</em>
using <code>Integer.parseInt()</code>. <code>Integer.parseInt()</code> is commonly used in Java: it takes in a String
as a parameter and <em>returns</em> an integer. There are similar methods for other numeric data types, such as
<code>Double.parseDouble()</code> for converting strings into doubles.</p>
<h2>Loops and conditionals in Java</h2>

<h3>The if statement in Java</h3>

<p>This example shows how to do an <code>if</code> statement in Java:
<pre>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GuessTheYearApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println ("Which year was the most recent London Olympics?");
        String yearAsString = scanner.nextLine();
        int year = Integer.parseInt(yearAsString);
        
        if(year==2012)
        {
            System.out.println("Correct!");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Wrong!");
        }
    }
}
</pre>
Hopefully you can recognise the <code>if</code> / <code>else</code> structure that you have seen
already in Python.  Note the use of the braces (curly brackets) { and } to begin and end the <em>code block</em> associated with the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> keywords.
</p>
<p>In addition,
we can also have one or more <code>else if</code> blocks to handle multiple conditions. These are the equivalent of <code>elif</code> in Python.</p>
<h3>Comparison and logical operators in Java</h3>
<p>Like other languages, Java has comparison and logical operators. The comparison operators you have met in Python also apply in Java, e.g. <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>!=</code>.</p>
<p>The logical operators are a bit different to Python. Rather than the words <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>not</code>, symbols are used:
    <ul>
    <li><code>&amp;&amp;</code> : and</li>
    <li><code>||</em>: or</code>
	<li><code>!</code> (in front of an expression) : <em>not</em> e.g. <code>if(!b)</code> is equivalent to <code>if(b == false)</code></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Loops in Java</h3>
<p>In common with other languages, you can write <em>loops</em> in Java. You should remember from COM411 that a <em>loop</em> involves <em>iteration</em>: repeating the same section of code over and over again until some condition is met. Java has four types of loops:
    <ul>
    <li>The while loop;</li>
    <li>The do/while loop;</li>
    <li>The for loop;</li>
    <li>The foreach loop.</li>
    </ul>
We will look at the first three for now.</p>

<h4>The "while" loop in Java</h4>

<p>The <code>while</code> loop has this syntax in Java:
<pre>
public class WhileLoopApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int i = 1;
        
        while(i &lt;= 10)
        {
            System.out.println("Number = " + i);
            System.out.println("Square of number = " + i*i);
            i++;
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<h4>The "do/while" loop in Java</h4>

<p>The <em>do/while</em> loop is similar to the while loop, but performs the check at the
<em>end of the loop</em> rather than the beginning. For example:
<pre>
public class DoWhileLoopApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        int i = 1;
        
        do
        {
            System.out.println("Number = " + i);
            System.out.println("Square of number = " + i*i);
            i++;
        }while(i &lt;= 10);
    }
}
</pre>
Sometimes the logic of a loop means that it's better to put the check at the end of the loop rather than the beginning, and the do/while loop allows us to do that. Note also how we need to put a semicolon after the <code>while</code> condition; this is because the statement ends here, whereas for a <code>while</code> loop the
condition is at the beginning of the loop.
<h4>The for loop</h4>
<p>Java also has a <code>for</code> loop, in common with many other languages, though the syntax is a bit different to Python.  The syntax is:
<pre>for(initialisation; continue condition; change)</pre>
where:
    <ul>
    <li><em>initialisation</em> is the start condition - typically the initialisation of a loop variable;</li>
    <li><em>continue condition</em> is the condition which must be true for the loop to continue;</li>
    <li><em>change</em> is the change each time the loop runs: typically we change the value of a loop variable here.</li>
    </ul>
Here is a full example:
<pre>
public class ForLoopApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {    
        for(int i=1; i &lt;= 10; i++)
        {
            System.out.println("Number = " + i);
            System.out.println("Square of number = " + i*i);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Classes and Objects in Java</h2>
<p>We will now look at how to create <em>classes and objects</em> in Java.
<h3>A Cat class</h3>
<p>Here is an example of a Java class representing a Cat:
<pre>
public class Cat
{
    private String name;
    private int age, weight;
    
    public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
    {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    
    public void walk()
    {
        this.weight--;
    }

    public void display()
    {
        System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight);
    }
}
</pre>
So what does this code mean?
<pre>public class Cat</pre>
This line states that we are creating a class called <code>Cat</code>. Remember that a class is a <em>blueprint</em>
or <em>specification</em> for all objects of that type. So the class will not actually create an 
individual, specific Cat, but instead, describes what Cats are and how they operate.</p>

<p>
<pre>private String name;</pre>
This line is defining an <em>attribute</em> called <code>name</code>. The line is saying that each Cat object
created using this class will have their own <code>name</code> attribute, representing their name. 
We will come on to the meaning of the keyword <code>private</code> a bit later.
</p>
<p>
<pre>private int age, weight;</pre>
This line does the same for the age and the weight, which are both integers.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
{
    this.name = nameIn;
    this.age = ageIn;
    this.weight = weightIn;
}
</pre>
This piece of code is called a <strong>CONSTRUCTOR</strong>. A <em>constructor</em> is a special <em>method</em> (see below) which is used to <em>initialise</em> objects of the current class. It is the equivalent of the initialisation method <code>__init__()</code> in Python.  <em>A constructor has the same name as the class</em>. (We will see the meaning of <code>public</code> later).
When we create an object (and you will see how to do this below) the <em>constructor is called</em>. It takes parameters It takes parameters
(<code>nameIn</code>, <code>ageIn</code> and <code>weightIn</code>) and <em>sets the attributes to the parameters passed in</em>. Remember the difference between attributes and parameters:
    <ul>
    <li>Parameters represent the information <em>coming in</em> from outside, such as from the <code>main()</code>.
    This is why I have named them name<em>In</em>, etc. You can think of them as <em>temporary</em>: a
    parameter is just there to get the information into objects of the class from outside.</li>
    <li>Attributes are <em>contained within the class</em>. Once an object of the class is created, it contains a series of attributes which are <em>permanent</em>: they last until the object is destroyed.</li>
    </ul>
Note also the use of the keyword <code>this</code> to represent the attributes. <code>this</code> represents 
<em>the current object we are working with</em>. It's the equivalent of <code>self</code> in Python, but does not need to be specified as a parameter. So the code will set the attributes of whichever object we're initialising to the parameters passed in.</p>
<p>(<code>this</code> is actually optional here, but I have included it for clarity).</p>
<p>
<pre>    
public void walk()
{
    this.weight--;
}
</pre>
This is a <em>method</em>, which, as we saw last year, is an <em>action</em> or something that 
objects of a class can <em>do</em>. A method is essentially a <em>function inside a class</em>. The method is called <code>walk()</code>. The effect of this method is
to walk a cat by reducing the cat's weight (<code>this.weight</code>) by one.
</p>
<p>
<pre>public void display()
{
    System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight)
}</pre>
This code defines another method called <code>display()</code> which displays the details of the cat.</p>
<h3>Creating objects of the Cat class</h3>
<p>I cannot emphasise strongly enough that the above code <em>does not actually create any specific Cat objects</em>. It merely <em>defines a Cat class, which is a blueprint or specification for what Cats are and what they do.</em> We need, in addition, to create <em>specific Cat objects</em> in our <code>main()</code> (or elsewhere outside the Cat class). Here is a <code>main()</code> which creates two Cat objects and calls methods of them:
<pre>
public class CatApp
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        Cat clyde = new Cat ("Clyde", 2, 5);
        Cat binnie = new Cat ("Binnie", 5, 4);
        
        clyde.display();
        binnie.display();
        
        clyde.walk();
        binnie.walk();
        
        clyde.display();
        binnie.display();
        
        clyde.walk();
        clyde.display();
    }
}
</pre>
How is this code working?
<pre>Cat clyde = new Cat ("Clyde", 2, 5);
Cat binnie = new Cat ("Binnie", 5, 4);</pre>
These two lines create <em>two specific Cat objects</em>, <code>clyde</code> and <code>binnie</code>. Note the keyword
<code>new</code>. This means that we are creating a <em>new</em> object of the specified class (<code>Cat</code> here).
Note also how we <em>pass into the object</em> three pieces of information: the <em>name</em> (e.g.
"Clyde"), the <em>age</em> (e.g. 5), and the <em>weight</em> (e.g. 4). These three pieces of information
become the <em>parameters</em> in the constructor. So if we revisit the constructor:
<pre>
public Cat (String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn)
{
    this.name = nameIn;
    this.age = ageIn;
    this.weight = weightIn;
}    
</pre>
When we create our first Cat,
<code>nameIn</code> takes the value "Clyde", <code>ageIn</code> takes the value 2, and <code>weightIn</code> takes the
value 5. Since the constructor then sets the attributes to these three parameters, the 
<code>name</code>, <code>age</code> and <code>weight</code> attributes of the object <code>clyde</code> will be "Clyde", 2, and
5 respectively. So when we display the object <code>clyde</code>:
<pre>clyde.display();</pre>
then the <code>display()</code> method will be called, which, if you remember, is as follows:
<pre>public void display()
{
    System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + " Age: " + this.age + " Weight: " + this.weight)
}</pre>
Since the <code>display()</code> method displays the name, age and weight attributes, which we set in the
constructor, the <code>display()</code> method will output:
<pre>Name: Clyde Age: 2 Weight: 5</pre>
</p>
<p>
Likewise for the second cat, we will set up a cat with a <code>name</code> attribute of "Binnie", an
<code>age</code> attribute of 5 and a <code>weight</code> attribute of 4, so that when we display Binnie we end up
with:
<pre>Name: Binnie Age: 5 Weight 4</pre>
</p>
<p>Having displayed the cats, we then <code>walk()</code> them:
<pre>clyde.walk();
binnie.walk();
</pre>
These two lines will call the <code>walk()</code> method on <code>clyde</code> and <code>binnie</code>. Since the effect of
the <code>walk()</code> method is to reduce the <code>weight</code> attribute of the current cat by one, when we
<code>display()</code> the two cats again, their weight will be reduced by one. We then <code>walk()</code> Clyde again
so Clyde's weight will be reduced by a further unit. </p>
<p>So the overall output of the program will be:
<pre>
Name: Clyde Age: 2 Weight: 5
Name: Binnie Age: 5 Weight 4
Name: Clyde Age: 2 Weight: 4
Name: Binnie Age: 5 Weight 3
Name: Clyde Age: 2 Weight: 3
</pre>
</p>


<h2>Exercise</h2>
<ol>
<li>Try out the "Hello World" example, to check your environment is working.</li>
<li>Write a simple Java program to input student details from the keyboard. The details should include name, course and mark. The first two should be <code>String</code>s and the mark should be a <code>double</code>. After reading in the details, print them. You do not, at this stage, have to create a <code>Student</code> class. Just use simple variables to store the data.</li>
<li>Change your program so that if the mark is below 0 or greater than 100, it is rejected with an error message.</li>
<li>Change your program so that 5 students are read in and printed, using a loop.</li>
<li>Create a new project (called <code>CatApp</code>) and add the <code>Cat</code> and <code>CatApp</code> classes above to it. You will need to create a <em>new class</em> for <code>Cat</code> (<code>CatApp</code> will be the default class created). To do this, select <em>File</em>/<em>New File</em> in Netbeans and then pick <em>Java class</em>:
<br />
<img src="../images/netbeans_newclass.png" alt="Creating a new Java class" />
<br />
Then, give your class a name (<code>Cat</code> in your case):
<br />
<img src="../images/netbeans_newclass_2.png" alt="Naming a new class" />
<br />
Then, copy and paste the code above into your <code>CatApp</code> and <code>Cat</code> classes, respectively.</li>
<li>Add an additional method to <code>Cat</code> called <code>eat()</code>. The <code>eat()</code> method should add one to the weight of the cat.</li>
<li>Extend the code in the <code>main()</code> of <code>CatApp</code> to create two Cats with these attributes:
<pre>Name: Flathead Age:7 Weight:10
Name: Cupra Age:2 Weight:7</pre>
Make Flathead eat twice, and display Flathead's details. Make Cupra walk four times, and display Cupra's details.
</li>
<li>Return to your original project from questions 2 to 4, to read in, and display, student details. Create a completely new class called <code>Student</code> to represent a student.
Give it the following attributes:
	<ul>
	<li><code>id</code>, representing the student's ID (<code>String</code>)</li>
	<li><code>name</code>, representing the student's name (<code>String</code>)</li>
	<li><code>course</code>, representing the student's course. (<code>String</code>)</li>
	<li><code>mark</code>, the student's mark (<code>Double</code>).</li>
	</ul>
Also give it the following methods.
	<ul>
	<li>A constructor, which initialises the four attributes.</li>
	<li><code>printDetails()</code> should print the details of the student (name, course and mark).
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Modify your <code>main()</code> from questions 2-4 to create a <code>Student</code> object each time the loop runs, using the details the user entered from the keyboard. Then, still within the loop, display each student by calling its <code>printDetails()</code> method. 
</li>
</ol>
