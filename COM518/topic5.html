<h2>Introduction to AJAX</h2>

<p><img src="../images/ajax2.png" alt="AJAX applications"/></p>
<p><em>AJAX</em> (<em>A</em>synchronous <em>J</em>avaScript <em>A</em>nd <em>X</em>ML) is an approach to developing highly interactive web applications in which the front-end (JavaScript running client-side in the browser) communicates with a web server <strong>in the background, without the page being reloaded.</strong> So, with AJAX we can create interactive, instant searches (such as that seen on Google) for example. Your client-side JavaScript code sends a request, and the server sends data back, typically in a pure-data format such as XML or JSON (even though AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and <em>XML</em>, JSON can also be used). The JSON or XML is then <em>parsed</em> (interpreted) by a second client-side JavaScript function, and the page dynamically updated with the new data.</p>
<p>For example, we could have an AJAX application to search for all products of a given type (e.g cornflakes). Our client-side, front-end JavaScript could send a product type, such as "Cornflakes", to a Node server, and the Node server could send back JSON containing all the cornflakes manufactured by different manufacturers. Then, a second JavaScript function (the AJAX <em>callback</em>), could receive the JSON from the server, parse (interpret it) and update the HTML front-end with the data provided in the JSON (all brands of cornflakes available).</p>
<p>
How might a user interact with an AJAX application? They might enter a search term in a form and click Go, and then the search results would be sent back from the server as JSON in the background, and <em>one small part of the page only</em> (as opposed to the entire page) updated with the search results. 
Furthermore,as  requests to the server are sent, and responses received, <em>in the background</em>.  so the user can <em>continue to interact with the page</em> while waiting for the response to come back.</p>

<p>
AJAX is not an actual language, but a combination of technologies used to produce the effect above. An AJAX application typically consists of three components:
<ul>
<li>
the client side application, usually JavaScript running in the browser which sends HTTP requests to a server and processes the response;</li>
<li>
a web server which receives the HTTP request sent from the JavaScript, above, and delivers the response;</li>
<li>
the data sent back from the server to the client, which is typically in a data description format such as JSON or XML.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id='cors'>The same-origin policy</h3>

<p>AJAX applications are normally subject to the <em>same-origin policy</em>. This means that the back-end (the server-side script that the JavaScript talks to) must be delivered from the same exact domain as the front-end. The reason for this is security: the ability for an AJAX front end to talk to a third-party server opens up the possibility of cross-site scripting.  According to the W3C on their <a href='http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy'>
same origin policy document</a>, with the same-origin policy "the overarching intent is to let users visit untrusted web sites without those web sites interfering with the user's session with honest web sites" - in other words, it prevents the possibility of a third-party AJAX-based site using AJAX to communicate with a legitimate site which the user might be currently
logged on to, which could lead to stealing of session-specific information.</p>
<p>
The domain must be exact; subdomains of a top-level domain are treated as different.  For example <em>booking.solentholidays.com</em> and
<em>hotels.solentholidays.com</em> are treated as different. This is because several users with different subdomains might be sharing the same top-level domain of a hosting company, e.g.  <em>fredsmith.solenthosting.com</em> and <em>timjones.solenthosting.com</em>.</p>

<h3>Circumventing the same-origin policy with CORS</h3>
<p>There is, however, a way in which server-side developers can circumvent the same origin policy in certain cases. This is done by explicitly allowing, on the server side, certain AJAX clients to connect.  A common case is where one person owns two domains, and would like the two domains to communicate with each other over AJAX. For example, Solent Holidays might have two domains, <em>hotels.solentholidays.com</em> and <em>booking.solentholidays.com</em> - and wishes to be able to send users' booking details from <em>booking.solentholidays.com</em> to a hotels web service on <em>hotels.solentholidays.com</em>. To do this, they would have to add code to the server-side scripts on <em>hotels.solentholidays.com</em> to <em>allow booking.solentholidays.com to connect</em>.
</p>

<p>This is done by using the technique of <em>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</em>.  An <em>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</em> headere is added to the HTTP response from the server the <em>header()</em> function, e.g. an HTTP response
might contain the header:
<pre>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: booking.solentholidays.com</pre>
which would allow the client at <em>booking.solentholidays.com</em> to connect
to the script.
</p>
<p>To add a CORS header to a Node/Express server, it's easy if you install the <code>cors</code> package:
<pre>npm install cors</pre>
You just use:
<pre>const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());</pre>
</p>

<h2>New style AJAX requests with the fetch API</h2>
<p>The easiest way to communicate with a server using AJAX is the
<em>fetch API</em>. Here is an example of the use of the fetch API. Note
that <strong>even though the server would normally send back a data format such as JSON or XML, in this example the server is simply sending back plain text, for simplicity</strong>.
<pre>
function ajaxSearch(productType) {
    fetch(`https://server/api/product/${productType}`)
        .then(response =&gt; response.text())
        .then(text =&gt; {
            document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
        });
}

// Make the AJAX run when we click a button
document.getElementById('ajaxButton').addEventListener('click', ()=&gt; {
    // Read the product type from a text field
    const product = document.getElementById('productType').value;
    ajaxSearch(product);
});
</pre>
How is this working?
<ul>
<li>We fetch a response from the given URL. Here we are contacting a 
server-side script which searches for all products of a given type.</li>
<li><em>then</em>, when we get the response, we obtain the text from it.</li>
<li><em>then</em>, when we have the raw text of the response, we run an 
arrow function to place the results inside a &lt;div&gt;. This arrow
function is passed the raw text of the response as a parameter.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Promises</h3>
<p>We'll now look in a bit more detail at what is going on with our fetch API
request, and in particular look at the concept of a <em>promise</em>. The
<code>fetch</code> call, above, returns a <em>Promise</em> object.
A promise is an object which "promises" to do a particular (typically)
asynchronous, background task which will complete at some point in the future,
such as an AJAX request. The <code>fetch()</code> function will return 
immediately, but will not do the AJAX request immediately. Instead, it returns
a <em>promise object</em> which will, at some point in the future, be either
<em>fulfilled</em> or <em>rejected</em>. These outcomes are as follows;
    <ul>
    <li>A promise is <em>fulfilled</em> or <em>resolved</em> as soon as the 
    background task completes successfully, for example when a response is
    received from an AJAX call;</li>
    <li>or it is <em>rejected</em> if it fails with an error, for example
    there is a network timeout on an AJAX call.</li>
    </ul>
We handle each of those two outcomes using the <code>then()</code> and
<code>catch()</code> functions. The function supplied as an argument to
<code>then</code> (the <strong>resolve</strong> function)
will run <strong>as soon as the promise is fulfilled</strong>
while the function supplied as an argument to <code>catch</code> will run 
<strong>as soon as the promise is rejected</strong>.
</p>
<p>
So, promises allow you to write code with intuitive, clean syntax in
this form:
<pre>promise.then(resolveFunction).catch(rejectFunction);</pre>
where "promise" is the promise object, and <code>resolveFunction</code> and
<code>rejectFunction</code> are the functions which run on fulfilment and
rejection, respectively.</p>
<p>Note that this topic does not include how to write your own promises from
scratch, only how to use promises returned from APIs written by others, for
example the fetch API. You can read about how to create your own promises in
the <a href='../wad/promises.html'>third-year notes on promises</a>.</p> 
<h4>Relating promises to the fetch API</h4>
<p>So, returning to our fetch API example, what is happening with this code in
terms of promises? (Note, I have now added a <code>catch()</code>).
<pre>
fetch(`https://server/api/product/${productType}`)
    .then(response =&gt; response.text())
    .then(text =&gt; {
        document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
    })
    .catch(e =&gt; { alert(`An error occurred: ${e}`); } );
</pre>
<ul>
<li>We make our <code>fetch()</code> request. This returns a promise, which
will resolve when we get a response back from the server.</li>
<li>We supply the arrow function <code>response =&gt; response.text()</code>
as the resolve function. This takes the response and obtains text from it.
Note that this is shorthand for:
<code>.then(response =&gt; { return response.text(); } );</code>
in other words, if an arrow function only returns a value and does not do
anything else, we can omit the curly brackets and the <code>return</code>.
</li>
<li>Note that <code>response.text()</code> does not return the text directly. Perhaps surprisingly, <code>response.text()</code> <strong>itself returns a promise</strong>, which will fulfil as soon as text is obtained from the response so we need <strong>yet another then()</strong> with a <strong>second resolve function</strong> passed as an argument, i.e:
<pre>
.then(text =&gt; {
    document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
});
</pre>
This second resolve function gets passed the text as a parameter, and
simply places this text inside a &lt;div&gt;.</li>
<li>Finally, any errors that might occur during the whole process are handled
with the <code>catch()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>async/await</h3>
<p>ECMAScript 8 (aka ECMAScript 2017) introduces <em>async/await</em>.
This allows you to write promise-based,
asynchronous code in a sequential manner. Here is how we would rewrite our
<em>fetch</em> API code using async/await:
<pre>
<em>async</em> function ajaxSearch(productType) {
    const response = <em>await</em> fetch(`https://server/api/product/${productType}`);
    const text = <em>await</em> response.text();
    document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
}

// Make the AJAX run when we click a button
document.getElementById('ajaxButton').addEventListener('click', ()=&gt; {
    // Read the product type from a text field
    const product = document.getElementById('productType').value;
    ajaxSearch(product);
});
</pre>
Note how we're doing a whole AJAX / JSON parsing procedure using sequential
code, even though AJAX is an asynchronous process. The key things are:
    <ul>
    <li>The function <em>ajaxSearch()</em> is declared as <em>async</em>, 
    which makes it a special kind of function (an <em>AsyncFunction</em>)
    allowing us to do async/await;</li>
    <li><em>fetch()</em> (which if you remember returns a promise to do an
    AJAX call) is preceded by <em>await</em>. What <em>await()</em> does is
    suspend execution of the rest of the <em>async</em> function until the
    promise concerned has been fulfilled. 
    The argument to the resolve function of
    the promise is then <em>returned</em> from the <em>await</em> call.
    </li>
    </ul>
Note also that <em>await</em> will only work with a promise. It's
<em>awaiting the successful resolution of that promise</em>. Trying to use
<em>await</em> without a Promise will not work!</li>
</p>
<p>To make the code more robust we need to handle errors. Here is how to
do this with <em>async/await</em>:
<pre>
<em>async</em> function ajaxSearch(productType) {
    try {
        const response = <em>await</em> fetch(`https://server/api/product/${productType}`);
        const text = <em>await</em> response.text();
        document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = text;
    } catch(e) {
        alert(`Error: ${e}`);
    }
}

// Make the AJAX run when we click a button
document.getElementById('ajaxButton').addEventListener('click', ()=&gt; {
    // Read the product type from a text field
    const product = document.getElementById('productType').value;
    ajaxSearch(product);
});
</pre>
Note how we <em>try</em> to do the promise based, asynchronous code and
<em>catch</em> any promise rejections in the <em>catch</em> block. The catch
block gets passed the error message accompanying the promise rejection.</p>
<h4>async/await with JSON</h4>
<p>The previous examples have shown <em>fetch()</em> AJAX requests which return
plain text. Here is a version which communicates with a server which returns
JSON instead:
<pre>
<em>async</em> function ajaxSearch(productType) {
    // Send a request to our remote URL
    const response = <em>await</em> fetch(`https://server/api/product/${productType}`);

    // Parse the JSON.
    const products = <em>await</em> response.json();

    // Loop through the array of JSON objects and add the results to a &lt;div&gt;
    let html = "";
    products.forEach ( product =&gt; {
        html += `Product Name: ${product.name} Manufacturer: ${product.manufacturer} Price: ${product.price}&lt;br /&gt;`;
    });
    document.getElementById('results').innerHTML = html;
}

// Make the AJAX run when we click a button
document.getElementById('ajaxButton').addEventListener('click', ()=&gt; {
    // Read the product type from a text field
    const product = document.getElementById('productType').value;
    ajaxSearch(product);
});
</pre>
This code is very similar to the text-based example. The main difference is
we use <code>response.json()</code> rather than <code>response.text()</code>.
This returns a promise which resolves when the JSON in the response has
been parsed (compare <code>response.text()</code>, which returns a promise
which resolves when we have extracted text from the response).</p>
<p>The other diference is that we need to loop through our array of JSON
objects returned from the server. The JSON might look like this:
<pre>
[
    {
        "name":"Cornflakes",
        "manufacturer":"Organic Products Ltd.",
        "price": 2.49 
    },
    {
        "name":"Cornflakes",
        "manufacturer":"Cockadoodle Cereal Co.",
        "price": 1.79 
    },
    {
        "name":"Cornflakes",
        "manufacturer":"Smith Emporium",
        "price": 0.79 
    },
]
</pre>
so hopefully you can see how we loop through each product object within the JSON
and extract the name, manufacturer and price fields from it. Notice also how
<code>forEach()</code> allows us to loop through each member of an array
without needing a <code>for</code> loop with an index. 
<code>forEach()</code> is a function which performs a second function on each member of an array. Each member of the array in turn is passed into this second function as a parameter.</p>
<h2>Exercises</h2>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT! Please ensure that you complete last week's exercises up to question 2 first.</strong></p> 
<p>Your aim is to develop <em>HitTastic!</em>, a website allowing users to
search for, and buy, music. You are going to develop a front-end for 
HitTastic! and connect it to your Node server that you wrote last week.</p>
<ol>
<li>Develop an HTML front end for HitTastic!, a site which allows you to search for, and buy, music online. If you are doing this in advance of the session, feel free to use a bit of creativity here and create an appealing front-end (though this is not compulsory!) Ensure that your HitTastic! page 
includes a form field to allow the user to enter an artist, and a button, which
when clicked, will connect, via AJAX, to your server. <strong>Place this page in a <code>public</code> folder, and use <code>express.static()</code> - see the end of week 3 - so that you can access it via your Node server</strong>, e.g. 
if your file is <code>hittastic.html</code> you would access it with:
<pre>http://localhost:3000/hittastic.html</pre>
</li>
<li>In a separate JavaScript file on the front-end, write an AJAX request function which connects to your <code>/artist</code> API endpoint from topic 4. You 
should <em>parse</em> the JSON returned.  Place the results within a &lt;div&gt;. Remember that you can use <em>innerHTML</em>
to fill a page element, e.g:
<pre>document.getElementById("div1").innerHTML = "New content!";</pre></li>
<li>Display the results in a table.</li>
<li>Add an additional column to the table. If the song was released before the
year 2000 (you can tell this from the <code>year</code> property in the JSON, based on the <code>year</code> column in the database) then display "CLASSIC HIT!" in this column.</li>
<li><strong>More advanced:</strong> Add an additional <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> box to the front-end. This should
contain the options Title, Artist or Year, allowing the user to search on
either title, artist or year.
<pre>
&lt;select id='searchType'&gt;
&lt;option&gt;title&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option&gt;artist&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option&gt;year&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre>
Next to this <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, add another text field, and a button labelled "Search by Type" and connect this to a new JavaScript function. This should read the search type from the select box (you can just use <code>document.getElementById(....).value</code> here, the same as for input boxes) and the search term from the text field, and then make a request to the appropriate API endpoint. You will need to add a new endpoint to your REST API to find all songs released in a given year, as you will not have done this last week.</li>
</ol>
