<h1>Additional Reading: JavaScript Prototypes</h1>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is additional reading, not essential for the module, but is a more advanced topic which some of you might find interesting. It describes JavaScript's underlying mechanism for creating many objects of the same type - <em>prototypes</em>. This is how classes work under the hood - when you create a class, you define a prototype.</p>
<h2>Constructors and Prototypes</h2>
<p>You have seen, when creating objects, that
there is a problem in which we were unable to easily
set up <em>many versions of similar objects</em>, such as many cats which all have different names but all work in the same way, i.e. all have the same methods.<h3>The Constructor</h3>
<p>If you have had experience of other object-orientated languages, you will have come across the <em>constructor</em>. The constructor is a special method used to define <em>how objects are created</em>.  In JavaScript, the constructor works <em>in a different way to other languages</em>. It is <em>an ordinary function</em> which is used to create objects when <em>used together with the "new" keyword</em>. What do we mean by this? Consider this function which could be used as a possible constructor: 
<pre>
function Cat(n, a)
{
    this.name = n;
    this.age = a;
}
</pre>
When <em>used with new</em>, this constructor
function can be used to create new Cats. It takes two parameters, n (the name)
and a (the age), and sets the <em>name</em> and <em>age</em> properties of objects created using this constructor
to those two parameters. (<em>"this"</em> refers to the object that will be created with the constructor). 
So we could use the constructor function to create two new Cat objects:
<pre>
<em>
var cat1 = new Cat("Tiddles", 10);
var cat2 = new Cat("Tigger", 7);
</em>
// Display the cats to show that it worked
alert(cat1.name + " " + cat1.age);
alert(cat2.name + " " + cat2.age);
</pre>
When the <em>new</em> keyword is used in code together with a function name (e.g. <em>Cat</em>) this tells JavaScript
to <em>create a new object</em> using the specified function (Cat here). Note that unlike other languages,
Cat is <em>not</em> a data type. It is simply a function name. </p>
<p>In fact, one could call Cat just like a regular function, but it wouldn't do a lot in that case. For instance
the code
<pre>
var cat1 = Cat("Tiddles",10); // <em>note no "new"</em>
</pre>
would be perfectly legal JavaScript, but wouldn't do anything, unless the Cat function returned something, in which
case the variable <em>cat1</em> would be assigned the return value of the Cat function.</p>
<h2>Prototypes</h2>
<p>The problem we have so far is that we have to <em>repeat code</em>
for several objects of a similar type. This also has the effect of
<em>creating multiple copies of methods in memory for each object of that
type</em>, which is very memory-inefficient. We can get round this problem
using <em>prototypes</em>.</p>
<p> Constructor functions have a special property, <em>prototype</em>, which defines a "blueprint" or "template"
object to use when creating new objects with that constructor. (How can a function, such as the constructor,
have properties? In
JavaScript, functions are a form of object, so because a function is an object, it can have properties).
So we can define a prototype for cats, by assigning properties and methods to the <em>prototype</em> property of
the Cat constructor, and then create many Cats which use that prototype.
<strong>Then, only one copy of these shared properties and methods need
be stored in memory.</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The code below shows this:
<pre>
function Cat(n,a,w)
{
    this.name=n;
    this.age=a;
    this.weight=w;
}


<em>Cat.prototype.species = "Felis catus";
Cat.prototype.nLegs = 4;
Cat.prototype.makeNoise = function() { alert("Meow!"); };
Cat.prototype.eat = function() { this.weight++; };</em>
</pre>
Note how we use the <em>prototype</em> property of the constructor function, Cat. The prototype property represents <em>the prototype of all
objects created with this constructor function</em>, in other words the prototype property of <em>all cats</em>.
So, all cats will have a prototype containing:
    <ul>
    <li>A species property of "Felis catus";</li>
    <li>a nLegs property of 4;</li>
    <li>a <em>makeNoise()</em> method which displays "Meow!" in an alert box.</li>
    <li>an <em>eat()</em> method.</li>
    </ul>
It should be noted that the prototype is <em>not</em> part of the individual cat objects themselves. It is a 
<em>separate</em> object which is shared between all objects created with the Cat constructor, i.e. all cat objects.
The diagram
below illustrates this.</p>
<p><img src="../images/prototypes1.png" alt="Object prototypes" /></p>

<p>We can prove that the prototype works with the following code:
<pre>
function Cat(n,a,w)
{
    this.name=n;
    this.age=a;
    this.weight=w;
}

// Setup the prototype in the "global" area, outside any functions
Cat.prototype.species = "Felis catus";
Cat.prototype.nLegs = 4;
Cat.prototype.makeNoise = function() { alert("Meow!"); };
Cat.prototype.eat = function() { this.weight++; };

// Function to test creating objects with prototypes - might be linked to a button
function testprototypes()
{
    var cat1 = new Cat("Tiddles", 10, 10);
    var cat2 = new Cat("Tigger", 7, 8);

    alert(cat1.species); // "Felis catus"
    alert(cat2.species); // "Felis catus"
    cat1.makeNoise(); // "Meow!"
    cat2.makeNoise(); // "Meow!"
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note how, even though <em>makeNoise()</em> and <em>species</em> are part of the <em>prototype</em>, we can
access them directly using simply the object name plus the method or property, for example <em>cat1.makeNoise()</em>
(we don't have to use something like <em>cat1.getPrototype().makeNoise()</em>). </p>
