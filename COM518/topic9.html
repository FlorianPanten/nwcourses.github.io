<h1>Topic 9: Passport</h1>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Passport is a Node module which can provide seamless authentication with a range of login providers, including Google, Facebook and the like, as well as local login with the usernames and passwords stored in your own database, as covered in Topic 6. The goal of Passport is to allow the use of common code to authenticate with many different providers.</p>  
<p>Passport is based around <em>strategies</em>. Each strategy represents a method of logging in with a different provider. So you have strategies for third-party login providers such as Google and Facebook, and you have the <em>local strategy</em> for managing local logins.</p>
<h2>Using Passport</h2>
<p>We will only cover the local strategy here in any detail, but the others
are described at the <a href='http://passportjs.org'>Passport website</a></p>
<p>To use Passport, you need to install it (you need to install a specific strategy as well as Passport itself):
<pre>npm install passport passport-local</pre>
In your code, first <code>require()</code> it, as usual for a third-party 
module:
<pre>const passport = require('passport');</pre>
You then import the specific strategy you want to use. For example, to use the local strategy, you would need to install <code>passport-local</code> and use it:
<pre>const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;</pre>
You then add each strategy you want to use to Passport as an item of middleware, using Passport's <code>use()</code> method. Each strategy defines how the login information is processed. We will examine code for a local strategy shortly.</p>
<p>How do you perform authentication with Passport?
    <ul>
    <li>Firstly, from your login route, you use the <code>passport.authenticate()</code> middleware, passing in a specific strategy as an argument. For example:
<pre>passport.authenticate('local');</pre>
will use the local strategy. This middleware will then call the appropriate strategy to actually perform the authentication.</li>
    <li>Then you <em>implement</em> your strategy. To do this, you create an appropriate Strategy object. You must pass the Strategy object a function which performs the authentication, and if the authentication succeeds, returns an object containing the user details.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>The login route</h3>
<p>We will illustrate this with a <code>/login</code> route, as this is the natural place to start in order to understand Passport. However, note that <em>this will not come first in your code</em>. It must come <em>after</em> you have setup a strategy, as it will use your strategy to perform the authentication.  A commented <code>/login</code> route is provided below. <code>passport</code> is the Passport object, imported as shown above.
<pre>
app.post('/login',
    // call passport's authenticate() method (which is actually middleware)
    // This will use the appropriate strategy to authenticate the user: the
    // local strategy is used here as we pass an argument of 'local'. 
    // The strategy must authenticate the user with the given credentials
    // and return an object containing the user details on completion.
    //
    // If the authentication fails, a 401 will be AUTOMATICALLY sent back.
    passport.authenticate('local'), 

    // The actual route handler, which actually sends a response back to the
    // client. This will be called once the strategy has
    // completed. (We can pass in multiple items of middleware, plus the 
    // final route handler function, as arguments to app.get(), app.post() etc).
    (req, res) =&gt; {
        // the strategy code will attach the user details to the request object 
        // 'req' as the property 'req.user'. This is explained below.
        // Here, we send 'req.user' back to the client as JSON.
        res.json(req.user); 
    }
);
</pre>
You are probably thinking: what happens to the username and password within
the request when we call <code>passport.authenticate()</code>? Passport 
assumes that these are present within <code>req.body</code> as 
<code>req.body.username</code> and <code>req.body.password</code>, and are
forwarded to the strategy.</p>
<h3>The LocalStrategy</h3>
<p>So we will now look at an example of a strategy, specifically a 
LocalStrategy. What do we do inside the strategy?
    <ul>
    <li>When creating a LocalStrategy object, you must supply it with a function
    that takes three parameters: <code>username</code>, <code>password</code>
    and <code>done</code>. The first two parameters are the username and
    password taken from the request body, while <code>done</code> is a 
    callback function that must be called to complete the authentication
    process (rather like <code>next</code> in Express middleware).</li>
    <li>We check that the username and password are correct</li>
    <li>If they are, we call the supplied <code>done()</code> callback
    with <code>null</code> as the first argument and an object containing
    the user details as the second.  This will call the route handler (or 
    the next item of middleware, if there is one) in the <code>/login</code>
    route. The user details are attached to the request object <code>req</code>
    as <code>req.user</code>; note how, above, we send back the 
    <code>req.user</code> object to the client as JSON if the authentication
    is successful.</li>
    <li>If they are incorrect, we call the supplied <code>done()</code>
    callback with <code>null</code> as the first argument and 
    <code>false</code> as the second. This will cause Passport to 
    generate a 401 (Unauthorized) response to send back to the client.</li>
    <li>If there is a database error, we call the supplied <code>done()</code>
    callback with the error as the first argument. This will cause Passport
    to generate a 500 (Internal Server Error) response to send back to the 
    client.</li>
	</ul>
This code must come <em>before</em> your <code>/login</code> route; it is only presented after it in these notes as it helps understanding of Passport if the <code>/login</code> route is explained before the strategy (because the <code>/login</code> will run first).
<pre>
// Note that the local strategy will AUTOMATICALLY read fields named 'username'
// and 'password' from req.body, and will supply them as parameters to the
// function passed in as an argument to LocalStrategy. So in the code below,
// 'username' and 'password' will contain the user's login credentials sent
// within a POST request.

passport.use(new LocalStrategy(async(username, password, done)=&gt; {
    // Imagine we have a user DAO which contains code to query the 'users' table
    const userDao = new UserDao(db);
    try {
        // imagine our user DAO has a method to check the username and password
        // against the database. It will return an object containing the full 
        // details of the user (username, user id, admin status) if the 
        // username and password is correct, or null otherwise.
        const userDetails = await userDao.login(username, password);

        // If null is returned, call the 'done()' callback with 'false' as
        // the second argument - to indicate authentication was unsuccessful
        // This will cause Passport to AUTOMATICALLY send back a 401 to the client
        if(userDetails === null) {
            return done(null, false);
        } else {
            // otherwise call the 'done()' callback with the user object as
            // the second argument. This will be automatically attached to 
            // the 'req' object as 'req.user'
            return done(null, userDetails);
        }
    } catch(e) {
        // If there were errors with the database (e.g could not connect to
        // the database), call 'done()' with the error as the first argument
        // This will AUTOMATICALLY send back a 500 error with the contents of
        // "e" in the response body.
        return done(e);
    }
}));
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Linking Passport to our application</h3>
<p>We must link Passport to our application as middleware. You need to add
the following lines to your main app.js:
<pre>app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());</pre>
The first middleware is for initialising Passport, the second for using 
Passport with sessions (see "Serialisation and deserialisation", below).
<strong>The <code>app.use(passport.session())</code> must come AFTER initialising <code>express.session</code>, as it relies on sessions having been setup 
already, but should also come BEFORE any other Passport code.</strong></p>
<h3>Serialisation and deserialisation - persisting the user across multiple requests</h3>
<p>We have implemented authentication with a local strategy, which results in the user details being saved in <code>req.user</code> if authentication was successful. However, how can we preserve information across multiple HTTP requests, as a user interacts with the website? <code>req.user</code>, being a property of the request object, only has a lifetime <em>within the current request</em>. To preserve the user across multiple requests, we need to make use of sessions, together with <em>serialisation</em>/<em>deserialisation</em>.  We need to define <em>serialisation</em> and <em>deserialisation</em> functions which saves user information to, and restores it from, <code>req.session</code> across requests. Specifically the serialised data is saved to <code>req.session.passport.user</code> within the session.</p>
<p>We perform this with the <code>serializeUser()</code> and <code>deserializeUser()</code> methods, which persist user information to the session, and restore it from the session, respectively. Typically we do not need to preserve <em>all</em> the user information in the session, just enough to identify the user - so the user ID will be fine. Each of these methods takes a callback function
(an arrow function here) which actually does the processing, and like the
strategy code above, this is supplied with a <code>done</code> callback which you need to call to complete the serialisation or deserialisation. 
<pre>
// Serialise function - persists the user from req.user to the session
// The parameter 'userDetails' is the information contained within 'req.user'
// We only need to save the ID, as that is sufficient to identify the user

passport.serializeUser((userDetails, done) =&gt; {
    done(null, userDetails.id);
});

// Deserialise function - restores the user from the session to req.user.
// It needs to perform a database query (using our DAO) to restore the full
// user details (username, admin status) using the ID.
// The full user object is passed to done(), this will result in it being
// attached to req.user.
passport.deserializeUser(async(userid, done) =&gt; {
    try {
        const userDao = new UserDao(db);

        // use the DAO to find the full user details from the user ID.
        const details = await userDao.findById(userid);

        // call "done()" with the full details. This will result in the details
        // being attached to the "req" object as "req.user".
        done(null, details);
    } catch(e) {
        // handle error by calling done() with the error information
        done(e);
    }
});
</pre>
</p>
<h3>Handling authentication errors</h3>
<p>How are authentication errors handled? If <code>done()</code> is called from your strategy with <code>false</code> as the second argument (to indicate that the login is invalid), Passport will <strong>automatically</strong> send back a 401 Unauthorized HTTP response to the client, which the client can then test for. However, you may want to supply a custom JSON response to the client.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to set up an additional route to send back the JSON, e.g:
<pre>
app.get('/badlogin', (req, res) =&gt; {
    res.status(401).json({error: "The login was invalid"});
});
</pre>
and then tell Passport to redirect to this route if the login fails using the <code>failureRedirect</code> option to <code>passport.authenticate()</code>, e.g:
<pre>passport.authenticate('local', { <strong>failureRedirect: '/badlogin'</strong> } )</pre>
</p>
<h2>Using another strategy</h2>
<p>Passport makes it easy to implement multiple strategies in the same application, which can be selected based on the argument passed to <code>passport.authenticate()</code>. I will not go into any detail as to how to implement strategies other than the local strategy, but I will show you a snippet of code making use of another strategy - the OpenStreetMap strategy - which allows you to login to a site using your <a href='https://openstreetmap.org'>OpenStreetMap</a> login details:
<pre>
passport.use(new OpenStreetMapStrategy({ 
    //OpenStreetMap options (omitted)...
}, (token, tokenSecret, profile, done) {
    // OpenStreetMap authentication callback function...
    return done (null, { id: profile.id, username: profile.displayName  } );
});
</pre>
I will not describe the OpenStreetMap strategy in any detail but you should
take note of the similarities to the local strategy. You will
notice that it takes a callback function which runs when the user has 
authenticated with OpenStreetMap. The <code>profile</code> object contains an
<code>id</code> field with the user's OpenStreetMap ID, and a <code>displayName</code> field with the
user's name, which can be placed in an object and passed to
<code>done()</code> in the same way as the local strategy. This object will
then be stored in <code>req.user</code>, as before.</p>
<p>Then, you could setup an OpenStreetMap login route to use the strategy:
<pre>
app.post('/osm/login',
    passport.authenticate('openstreetmap'); // use OpenStreetMap strategy
});
</pre>
