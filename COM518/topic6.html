<h1>Topic 6: Further AJAX</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Last week we looked at AJAX and saw how to develop an AJAX front-end to
a web API which sends GET requests to the API and parses the JSON returned.
This week we will extend upon that by looking at how we can send <em>POST</em>
requests to a web API and use the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em> to
dynamically manipulate the page.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will look at:
    <ul>
    <li>How to retrieve an HTTP status code from an AJAX client;</li>
    <li>How to send POST requests from an AJAX client</li>
    <li>The Document Object Model (DOM)</li> 
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>How to test the HTTP status code from an AJAX client</h3>
<p>It is easy to test the HTTP status code from a web service client. If you are using AJAX you can simply use
the <em>status</em> property of the <em>response</em> object. For example, this
code will test for a 404: 
<pre>const response = await fetch('https://example.com/product/223');
if(response.status == 404) {
    alert("The product was not found!");
} else {
    const data = await response.json();
    // etc...
}</pre>
</p>
<h3>POST requests from AJAX</h3>
<p>To send POST requests from AJAX, you need to create a POST request from
the fetch API and specify the data you want to send and the <code>Content-Type</code> header, much like you do in RESTer. Here is a code snippet which will send
a POST request to a <code>/newproduct</code> endpoint:
<pre>const product = {
    name: "Cornflakes",
    manufacturer: "Organic Products Ltd",
    price: 2.79
};

const response = await fetch('https://example.com/products/newproduct', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type' : 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(product)
});</pre>
Note how we send a <code>fetch()</code> request to the given URL, but this
time, we have to specify a number of options in a JavaScript object as a second argument to the <code>fetch()</code> function. These are:
    <ul>
    <li>the HTTP method (POST here);</li>
    <li>the HTTP headers we want to add to the request. This is itself a JavaScript object containing a series of property/value pairs, the properties being the header name and the value, its value. So here, we are setting the <code>Content-Type</code> header to <code>application/json</code>.</li>
    <li>The request body. This is a JSON string representing the data we want to send. Note that here, we create the JSON by specifying a JavaScript object <code>product</code>, containing product details, and then convert it to a JSON string with <code>JSON.stringify()</code>.
    </li>
    </ul>
<h2>Querying and Manipulating HTML documents using the DOM</h2>
<p>
Previously you've seen the <em>innerHTML</em> property which can be used to read, or change, the text within an HTML element. You've also looked at simple use of the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em> to access elements on a web page -
specifically the use of <em>getElementById()</em> to access a specific 
page element using its ID.</p>
<p> However that's just the start: the DOM offers a whole range of ways to read and manipulate HTML pages or XML data. To understand how you can use DOM for document manipulation, you must understand the concept of <em>nodes</em>, which we will discuss below.  The examples below use the DOM to manipulate HTML documents, however, more generally, the DOM is used for accessing and manipulating XML documents. An HTML web page is a particular, specific type of XML document. So, as well as using the DOM to query and manipulate web pages, we can use it in a more general sense to query and manipulate XML. In AJAX, this latter use of the DOM is used extensively.</p> 

<h3>The Concept of Nodes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Part of the W3C Document Object Model (DOM)</li>
<li>A systematic way to navigate and manipulate the content of an HTML or XML document, not
only the <em>elements</em>, but also the <em>text within them</em></li>
<li>An HTML or XML document consists of a series of hierarchical <em>nodes</em></li>
<li>Each <em>element</em> (e.g <em>p</em>, <em>div</em>, or <em>em</em>
in HTML; or a custom tag in XML) is treated as a <em>node</em>
</li>
<li>However it's not just the elements themselves:
the <em>text</em> within each element is also treated as a special kind of node, a <em>text node</em></li>
<li>The nodes are a <em>nested</em>, <em>hierarchical</em> structure</li>

    <ul class="subpoint">
    <li>An element within an element is a <em>child node</em> of that element
    </li>
    </ul>

</ul>
<h3>Example of Nodes Terminology</h3>
<pre>&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Welcome to the <em>&lt;em&gt;wonderful!&lt;/em&gt;</em> world of dynamic text!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>

<li>The paragraph is a <em>child node</em> of the <em>body</em></li>

<li>The paragraph contains <strong>three</strong> of its own <em>child nodes</em>:</li>
    <ul>    
    <li>The <strong>text</strong>: <em>"Welcome to the"</em></li>
    <li>The <strong>em</strong> element</li>

    <li>The <strong>text</strong>: <em>"world of dynamic text!"</em></li>
    </ul>

<li>The <strong>em</strong> <em>itself</em> contains one child node:
    <ul>
    <li>The <strong>text</strong>: <em>"wonderful!"</em></li>

    <li>This is a child of the <strong>em</strong> not the 
    <strong>p</strong></li>
    </ul>
</li>

<h3>Querying the Node Structure of a Document</h3>
<ul>
<li>document.body.<em>childNodes</em> is an <em>array</em> of all
child nodes of the body
    <ul class="subpoint">

    <li>i.e. all elements and text within the page</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>node.<em>childNodes</em> is an array of all child nodes of
a given node (i.e. element)</li>
<li>node.<em>nodeName</em> gives the <em>name</em> of a node
    <ul class="subpoint">

    <li>i.e.  em, p, song, artist, etc; or <em>#text</em> for text nodes</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>node.<em>nodeValue</em> gives the <em>text within a text node
<strong>(only)</strong></em>
    <ul class="subpoint">

    <li>It has no meaning for page elements</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="examples/dom/node_query.html">Example</a>
</p>
<h3>Adding a new node</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the keys to dynamic text</li>
<li><em>document.createElement()</em> allows us to <em>create a brand
new element!</em></li>

<li><em>document.createTextNode()</em> allows us to create a brand new
text node</li>
<li>Having created an element we can then populate it with text nodes
and child elements</li>
<li>... and finally add it to either:
    <ul>
    <li>The body</li>
    <li>Another element, which will act as its parent</li>
    </ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p>
<a href="examples/dom/node_add.html">Example</a>
</p>
<h3>Replacing an existing node</h3>
<ul>
<li>The other key to dynamic text</li>
<li>We can <em>replace a whole paragraph of text with another!!!</em></li>
<li>Steps:
    <ul>
    <li>Find the element to replace</li>
    <li>Create a new element (as per the previous example)</li>

    <li>Call <em>replaceChild()</em> to replace the old
    node with the new</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="examples/dom/node_replace.html">Example</a></p>
<h3>Getting all elements of a particular type</h3>
<ul>
<li>It can make it easier to find a page element if we can collect
together all elements of a particular type (e.g. all paragraphs)</li>

<li><em>document.getElementsByTagName()</em> allows us to do this
</li>
<li>This gives us an <em>array</em> of all elements of a particular
type, which we can then index</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="examples/dom/bytagname.html">Example</a></p>
<h3>Removing nodes</h3>
<ul>

<li>The final key concept of dynamic text is <em>removing</em> a particular
node</li>
<li>Use 
<pre>parentElement.removeChild(childElement)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Use IDs or <em>getElementByTagName()</em> once again to find
the element to remove</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other useful features of the DOM</h3>
<p>(Source:
<a href='http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html'>Quirksmode</a>, a very useful reference site for JavaScript
and the DOM)</p>

<ul>
<li><em>childNodes</em> property - an array of all the child nodes of a given node.e.g.:
<pre>
parent.childNodes.forEach ( childNode =&gt; {
        alert(childNode.nodeName); // show name of the node
});
</pre>
</li>
<li><em>firstChild</em> and <em>lastChild</em> properties - the first and last 
child node of a given node. e.g.
<pre>

// create a child node of the parent, assume that 'parent' has no children yet
var p = document.createElement("p");
parent.appendChild(p);

// create a text node
var textNode = document.createTextNode("some text");

// append it to the first child of the node 'parent', which will be the
// paragraph we created above. In other words 'p' and 'parent.firstChild'
// are the same in this case.
parent.firstChild.appendChild(textNode);
</pre>
</li>
<li> <em>document.querySelector()</em> 
and <em>document.querySelectorAll()</em> give the first
element, and all elements, which match a CSS selector respectively, eg
<pre>document.querySelectorAll(".important")</pre>
will give an array of all elements with a class of <em>important</em>.
See <a href="examples/dom/selector.html">Example</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inspecting elements</h3>
<p>The <em>inspect</em> functionality in the browser will help you see
what's going on - try it as you do the exercise for this week - right click on an element. Inspecting helps you to see the actual current DOM structure of the
page - including any dynamically-created elements.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>The main exercise is to add "Buy" functionality to your AJAX front-end
fron last week, so that a user can buy a given song. Songs will be bought by sending an AJAX POST request to the "buy" route of your web API.</p>
<p>Modify your AJAX front-end so that there is a "Buy" button for each search result. When the user clicks on the "Buy" button, you should call another function which sends an AJAX POST request to your "buy" route from week 3. Initially, do this by adding the button to the HTML string and setting an <code>onclick</code> property on the button which calls a new <code>buy()</code> function, for example:
<pre>html += `&lt;input type='button' value='Buy!' onclick='buy(${the song ID from the JSON})' /&gt;`;</pre>
Then, write a <code>buy()</code> function in your client-side JavaScript, which takes the song ID as a parameter and sends an AJAX POST request to your Buy route on your web API:
<pre>
function buy(songID) {
    // ... AJAX POST request - for you to complete
}
</pre>
</p>
<p> 
<h2>More advanced exercise - writing the Buy functionality using the DOM</h2>
<p>The first exercise was a simple approach to linking your search results to the Buy functionality. However the approach taken, of embedding the <code>buy()</code> call in your HTML, is rather messy as it mixes HTML and JavaScript and is not unobtrusive JavaScript. So this exercise allows you to rewrite it in a cleaner way using the DOM.</p>

<p>Make a copy, in a new file, of your existing HitTastic!  AJAX page. Delete all the existing code in the <em>forEach</em> arrow function and and replace it with the code below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add code to <em>create a DOM paragraph (p) element</em>
for each song returned.</li>
<li>Within this <em>p</em>, create:
    <ul>
    <li>a text node containing the details of the song, and </li>
    <li>a button node (i.e. an 
    "input" with a type of "button") allowing the user to buy 
    the song. Add both to the paragraph node using <em>appendChild()</em>. 
    </li>
    </ul>
To make sure that the button is an input with a type of "button", you 
need to set the "type" property to "button", i.e. if <em>btn</em> is your 
button, then you can use: <pre>btn.type = "button";</pre>
</li>
<li>Specify the text on the button by setting the "value" property:
<pre>btn.value="Buy!";</pre>
</li>
<li>Set up a "click" event handler for the button. as an arrow function, e.g: 
<pre>
btn.addEventListener ("click", e =&gt; 
    { 
        // fill in your arrow function here.
        // It should call your "buy" web API route, passing in the ID of the current song.
    } 
);
</pre>
This will set the "click" handler of the button to be an arrow function.</li>
<li>Add each paragraph to the results div using <em>appendChild()</em>.</li>
<li>You can now complete the arrow function which runs when the user clicks
the button. Use AJAX to call the "buy" route of your web API.
You will need to call the web API using a method of POST (see above),
though in this case you will not need to send any FormData.
</li>
<li>
The callback to the AJAX buy request should 
display a "Successfully bought" message, e.g. in an alert box.</li>
<li>Add error handling to the "buy" route of your web API so that if the required song is out of stock (quantity is 0), a 404 is returned. You will need to add an additional SELECT statement for this to work.</li>
<li>Alter your AJAX front end to check for a 404 from the "buy" 
route of your web API. In the callback, display a different message
depending on whether the song was bought successfully or not.</li> 
<li><strong>More advanced:</strong> Alter your "buy" route to be able
to buy more than one copy of the song (receive the quantity as POST
data). Update your AJAX front end to allow the user to enter the quantity,
and send the entered quantity to the web service.
<strong>As this is an advanced question, I am leaving it up to you to figure
out how to do this</strong> but if you are really stuck, I will give you some
<em>hints</em>. However, as it's advanced I will not write it for you!</li>
